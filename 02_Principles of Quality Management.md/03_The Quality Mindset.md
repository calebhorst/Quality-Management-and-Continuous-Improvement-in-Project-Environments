## The Quality Mindset
```
In order for us to create a high quality outcome on the project, we need to have a firm understanding of what the needs of our stakeholders actually are. This means that we need these expressed needs to be explicit and defined in nature. This ties in with the activities a business. analyst will often undertake, eliciting these sorts of requirements from our various stakeholders to understand what type of objectives the project team should seek to achieve. But in addition to these explicit and defined criteria, we also need to incorporate, to the best of our ability, the implicit and assumed type of needs that we might not have explicitly captured. Ideally, these will be few. We'll mostly have determined exactly what needs to be done in a very explicit fashion, but every project will encounter those sorts of assumptions that might have been made on the part of the stakeholder or those sorts of ways of doing work that are built into our organization's culture that are not going to be explicitly captured. As such, we need to consider these as well. Our expressed needs should also include those that are related to the project work itself, as well as those that are related to the actual output of our project work. We may find these sorts of expressed needs in the contracts that our project team may be party to, from our stakeholders with whom we make these sorts of conversations and discussions to elicit requirements, from various regulations that might apply, as well as organizational policies. This mixture of documents helps us to understand what exactly we need to achieve as part of the project team and the quality standards that we should be seeking to achieve as well. Our expressed needs can then be converted into the acceptance criteria that contractually determine whether or not we've actually met our objectives on the project, but they also help us to understand the attributes that we refer to as the fitness of our solution. Out of these two items come our requirements, our specific defined criteria that we're seeking to achieve on the initiative after which we can consider our work to be completed successfully. I want to look a little bit closer and solution fitness since acceptance criteria is quite clear and understandable, but this leaves a little bit of room for interpretation. Solution fitness includes design conformity, making sure that we meet criteria that may impact integration of the solution we develop with other portions of the organization's work. After all, in a vacuum, our solution might work great. But when we in fact launch it into the organization at large, things suddenly begin to go awry. Consider, for example, that we've developed a new type of pickup truck for an automotive company, and our customers love it. It's incredibly spacious. It has incredible towing capacity. They can put just about anything into the flatbed. But the problem is it's actually as wide as two car lanes. Now, this might be a little bit silly, but we run into these sorts of issues all the time in more technical and drab sorts of fashions where we haven't considered exactly how we might integrate the solution, And then we have to go back to create compromises later on, impacting the performance of our solution in order to help it better integrate, or taking away from some other features, or expending more resources in order for us to allow these pieces to all fit together. Inevitably, we lose performance, we lose value, and potentially, we lose quality through this process. This, of course, would be the antithesis of efficiency, which is another one of our fitness criteria. We wish to create the desired result at minimum expenditure of resources, time, budget, and so forth for the project team. How can we accomplish our role most effectively? And then how can we ensure that the output of our work also accomplishes its tasks as effectively as possible? We don't wish to create some sort of Rube Goldberg style machine that goes through a series of preposterous steps in order to achieve a desired outcome. Rather, we want to strive to create things that seem almost overly simplistic in their final form because we've done such a good job of pairing away and continuing to carve out those sorts of features, or functions, or tasks that might not be essential to our ability to accomplish our goals. Rather, we want our solution to be as streamlined, as clear cut as possible. Performance also matters. Does what we create function as intended and as envisioned? It's not enough to simply accomplish the task some +time. Is it able to accomplish the task when we need it to, faster than an old solution might have done so, able to do so on a reliable basis, and so forth? This goes into reliability. Does it work with undue maintenance or downtime? Is the solution that we develop something that our customers can in fact trust to be there for them and to accomplish those tasks? Or is it something they might not trust because it only works some of the time? How resilient is our solution? Is it able to withstand unforeseen developments and failures? Can we return it to service quickly following any issues that do take place? This goes into the idea of up time, both from a reliability and resiliency point of view, especially when developing software, but this is something that's important for just about any type of project we might undertake. How well liked and how well adopted by intended users is the solution that we have indeed created. This, after all, is the ultimate measure of satisfaction. It's one thing for stakeholders to say, sure, yeah, we we kind of like that. And it's another to see them actually using it, benefiting from it, and able to take advantage of the functionality we create. Finally, how uniform is the output of our solution that we develop? Is it consistent in meeting requirements every time, not only something that is reliable in terms of being there and resilient in terms of being able to work in an environment that might not be ideal, but also in creating the outcome that we expect and that we rely on time after time? In order to ensure that these sorts of solution fitness components have been met, we can manage our quality from two different perspectives. When it comes to our deliverables, the actual work of the project, inspection and testing allow us to see if what we create lives up to these sorts of criteria. On the other hand, when it comes to our project activities that allow us to create these sorts of outputs in the first place, we rely on a series of reviews to reflect on how we're accomplishing our work and how we're creating the deliverables that our customer can benefit from. Our reviews might include looking at how quickly project work begins offering value to the customer, as well as what processes empower us to minimize defects, rework, and wasted effort. Quite simply, we want to be efficient in our approach in creating the solution, just as we want the solution itself to be efficient. And, especially in agile teams where we're trying to focus on our value delivery, ensuring that we sequence our work, and instill the sort of quality principles necessary to deliver maximized value to our customer, it is essential to our definition of project success. Quality management applies to both project processes and the results of our project work; however, the methods for managing quality are unique to each project. Unfortunately, there's not a standard quality management strategy that I can share with you that works in every case. After all, the objectives of every project are different, the priorities of the project team are different, the customers or end users are going to be different, and so forth. So next, we'll look at how we can integrate quality management into our project initiatives to better promote these sorts of quality principles within our work and ensure that quality makes itself apparent in our deliverables as well.

## Notes
Key points regarding understanding and managing quality in project management:

1. **Understanding Stakeholder Needs**: To create high-quality project outcomes, it's essential to understand explicit, defined needs and also incorporate implicit and assumed needs that stakeholders might not have explicitly expressed.

2. **Sources of Expressed Needs**: Expressed needs come from stakeholders, contracts, regulations, and organizational policies, providing guidance on project objectives and quality standards.

3. **Conversion to Acceptance Criteria**: Expressed needs can be converted into acceptance criteria that determine whether project objectives have been met successfully.

4. **Solution Fitness**: Beyond acceptance criteria, solution fitness includes design conformity, integration considerations, efficiency, performance, reliability, resiliency, user satisfaction, and uniformity of output.

5. **Efficiency**: High-quality solutions are efficient, achieving desired results with minimal resource expenditure, such as time and budget.

6. **Performance and Reliability**: Quality solutions function as intended, perform reliably, and work with minimal maintenance or downtime.

7. **Resiliency**: Resilient solutions can withstand unforeseen challenges and return to normal operation quickly.

8. **User Satisfaction**: A measure of quality is how well-liked and adopted a solution is by its intended users.

9. **Uniformity**: High-quality solutions consistently meet requirements every time.

10. **Managing Quality**: Quality management involves inspection and testing of deliverables to ensure they meet quality criteria.

11. **Project Reviews**: Reviews of project activities and processes help in assessing efficiency, minimizing defects, and ensuring value delivery.

12. **Customized Quality Management**: Quality management strategies are unique to each project due to differing objectives, priorities, stakeholders, and contexts.

13. **Integration of Quality**: Integrating quality management into project initiatives promotes quality principles within the project and ensures high-quality deliverables.

Overall, understanding stakeholder needs, converting them into acceptance criteria, and assessing solution fitness are crucial steps in achieving quality in project management. Quality management should be tailored to each project's specific requirements and objectives.
