## Measuring and Analyzing Quality
```
In order to establish quality criteria, we also have to establish a method for measuring whether or not we've met that criteria successfully. Quality metrics should be designed in advance of our work in order to measure performance and outcomes and let us know whether or not we actually have achieved what we set out to achieve. If we don't set these metrics before we begin our work, then we can't create an objective measurement system. It's not good enough to simply create something and then, based on how it performs, determine well we'll consider that to be the quality criteria. This doesn't accomplish anything except perhaps serve to help hide the fact that we haven't thought about our quality outcomes and what we expect of our project work. Metrics can focus on either the project or the product attributes that align with goals. So this could have to do with how our team itself operates or on what we actually create. We may have various metrics in mind regarding how quickly or efficiently or with what resources we expect to be able to complete certain components of our project work, but then those components have to live up to some standards as well. Quality assurance efforts helped to ensure that work meets goals while our production work continues, while quality control ensures that the output of our work meets goals once production is complete. Metrics can be used for both QA and QC purposes. Some examples of metrics that we might put into use include the percent of tasks completed when expected. This helps us to measure the quality of our approach to the project work. The cost performance of our project activities would do so as well. The failure rate of projectâ€‘developed components would instead measure how high quality the output of our work might be as with the number of defects that are discovered during or after delivery of a component. Here, we might learn a great deal both about the results of our labor, but also about how we've conducted our work itself. Finally, customer satisfaction with delivered components can also serve as an important feedback tool to help us understand how high quality our results indeed have been. We are able to scour this sort of quality data from a variety of sources, including checklists that we follow in order to verify our work as it continues, sensors that can help us to understand the properties or the performance level of what our creation might be. We may gauge the output itself using a variety of measures, as well as the feedback that we receive from others. Checklists in particular are worth pointing out for their value here. Standardized checklists can help in both quality assurance and quality control efforts. They help us to make sure we're doing the right thing as our work is underway, and they can help us in reviewing that work to ensure that we've met the sort of characteristics and properties that we've defined in advance. Organization or industry groups may have checklists available for a variety of tasks or types of material that we might build. This can save us a great deal of time, allowing us to learn from the best practices of others. Checklists created by the project team may also later prove useful in delivery to the customer. After all, if we create a checklist that runs us through how we can use the output of our project work, such as a piece of software we might develop, we might be able to then convert that into an actual operations manual that those individuals can follow in the future as well. It's critical for checklists to be universally updated if procedures are changed after they've initially been implemented and defined. After all, if we've changed what our objectives might be, then we need to change how we verify that those objectives have been met. And checklists can be used in one of two capacities, either in a do and then check method where we accomplish our work and then verify it or in a check then do method where we follow the instructions that the checklist provides to ensure that we don't miss anything and that we go in the order that we've premeditated and decided was most important for discovering what our quality characteristics might be. This check then do method is more desirable than a do then check method would be. Analyzing documents allows us to collect quality information from a variety of different reports. Setting criteria in advance makes analysis much simpler to undertake in an objective fashion using these sorts of reports and performance data available to us. Ensuring that reports are associated with the context that's necessary for understanding is very important, however, especially if we're going to share these reports with other stakeholders, such as our customer or sponsor, who might not be able to understand the raw quality data that we have been able to obtain. But rather they are able to understand what these reports actually mean so long as we provide them with that necessary background.

## Notes
Establishing quality criteria and defining metrics for measuring quality are fundamental aspects of effective quality management in project initiatives. Quality metrics provide a structured way to assess whether project objectives are met and whether the outcomes align with predefined quality standards. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Metrics Design in Advance**: Quality metrics should be designed and established before the project work begins. Waiting until after the work is completed to set quality criteria is not effective. Setting metrics in advance provides an objective measurement system to evaluate performance and outcomes.

2. **Focus on Project and Product Attributes**: Quality metrics can focus on both project attributes (how the team operates) and product attributes (what is created). This dual focus helps ensure that the project work itself is efficient and that the output meets quality standards.

3. **Quality Assurance (QA) vs. Quality Control (QC)**:
   - **Quality Assurance (QA)**: QA efforts focus on ensuring that the work meets goals while the project is ongoing. It is proactive and aims to prevent issues.
   - **Quality Control (QC)**: QC ensures that the output of the work meets goals once production is complete. It involves reviewing the completed work for quality.

4. **Examples of Quality Metrics**:
   - Percent of tasks completed on schedule: Measures the quality of project planning and execution.
   - Cost performance of project activities: Evaluates the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of project work.
   - Failure rate of project-developed components: Measures the quality of the output by assessing defects or failures.
   - Customer satisfaction with delivered components: Provides feedback on how well the results meet customer expectations.

5. **Data Sources for Quality Metrics**:
   - **Checklists**: Standardized checklists help ensure that tasks are performed correctly during project execution and reviewed during quality control.
   - **Sensors**: In some cases, sensors can provide data on properties and performance levels of project components.
   - **Feedback**: Customer feedback and input from stakeholders can be valuable sources of quality information.
   - **Documents and Reports**: Analyzing project documents and reports can reveal valuable insights into quality performance.

6. **Checklist Usage**:
   - Checklists can be used in two ways: "Do and Then Check" (perform the work first and then verify against the checklist) or "Check Then Do" (follow the checklist instructions to ensure tasks are completed correctly). The "Check Then Do" method is more desirable for quality assurance.

7. **Analyzing Documents**:
   - Analyzing project documents and reports is essential for collecting quality information. These documents should be associated with the necessary context to ensure that stakeholders can understand the data and its implications.

8. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Ensure that documentation, including checklists and reports, is regularly updated to reflect any changes in project objectives, standards, or procedures. This helps maintain the relevance and accuracy of quality metrics.

By defining quality criteria, designing appropriate metrics, and utilizing various data sources and documentation, project teams can effectively manage and improve the quality of their work, leading to better outcomes and higher customer satisfaction.
