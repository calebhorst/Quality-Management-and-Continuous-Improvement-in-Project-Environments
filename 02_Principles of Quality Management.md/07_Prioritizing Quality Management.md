## Prioritizing Quality Management
```
As is true for all different facets of project management, given the competing priorities and the resource limitations that we face, quality management is a matter of balancing costs and benefits to ensure that the time that we put into quality management and where we put our priorities actually best aligns with what will serve the customer and the project best. Cost benefit analysis can be useful in determining the scope of our quality management efforts, and it's essential to assessing alternative courses of action that would allow us to meet our objectives. After all, there may be several different approaches that we can take, some more or less risky, some of which will allow us to better understand and assess our quality as work continues versus others where we might not be able to do much to gauge that performance until more of our work is complete and so on. Remembering that our costs of quality include those that are related to prevention, appraisal, as well as failure can help us in making sure that we assess this cost/benefit relationship correctly. After all, just because there might not be direct early costs associated with moving right ahead without thinking or checking too much what our work looks like doesn't mean that we're not going to have to pay for that on the back end when we verify or get complaints from the customer that we failed to meet what those expectations might be. Remember, projects begin with a business case that outlines why action should be taken based on a needs assessment that indicates what we might seek to accomplish, as well as a defined list of desired outcomes that help to meet those needs. From this point, we can move forward to analyze various alternatives for action, judging items such as the scope of action that we might undertake, the feasibility of this particular strategy, the risks that might be entailed, and the value that we expect can actually be created through this work. By going through this alternatives analysis, we can arrive at a recommended solution for our work. But going through this alternatives analysis requires us to find a way to objectively assess what each of these different alternatives might look like. Weighted matrices can be useful in determining what our quality priorities and methods might be, and decisions may involve the way that the project work is conducted or the product that the project team is creating. So ensuring that we consider both of these aspects in the ways that we assess our potential quality approaches is important as well. Another important factor to keep in mind is that it's entirely possible that of all the alternatives that we consider early on the project, we may find that we are unable through our quality criteria to, at this point, create a solution that would be acceptable. We may recommend taking no action at all if this is the case. Perhaps the benefit is simply predicted to be too far below what the cost might be in order to create whatever our improvement might have been. Or it might be that the level of risk is too high or that we're not going to be able to gauge the quality of our work effectively enough to merit it moving forward. In another case, we might find that one option is the clear winner. This is the easy scenario where we know right away that we're going to recommend option E. However, more likely we're going to have several possible routes that we could take in order to accomplish a very similar set of goals. So what do we do in this sort of case? Well, a weighted ranking allows us to assign a percentage weighting to each of several different factors. Criteria and weightings that we use in order to complete this analysis will differ based on the situation, as well as what our organization's priorities more broadly might look like. Criteria and weightings, however, should be in line with our relevant goals and objectives. So if we think that it's really important for us to be able to deliver on time, then that factor should receive a high weighting within our system. Pair‑matching allows each option to be compared to every other option in a way that allows us to more closely judge those different items that might have a very similar score if we use just a weighted ranking system. Consensus of key stakeholders should be built around weighting and ranking processes so that we make sure that everyone understands and agrees with what criteria we might be using to judge both the quality outcomes of this approach, as well as the other factors that will weigh in to our project decision making. For example, we may give cost effectiveness of a potential solution a weight of 35% and end up seeing that solution D is the one that we find most palatable in this regard. Technical feasibility might weigh in at 40% if we have a lot of uncertainty regarding certain options versus others where we know that that's going to work, that we can create a high‑quality result and that it's well within the capabilities of the organization to execute. Here solution A appears to be the clear winner. Operational feasibility carries a 25% weight here where we're considering whether or not our customer, in this case users within the organization, will actually be able to implement the results successfully. Here based perhaps on their prior experience with a similar piece of software, solution D once again pulls ahead. Here we can see a pretty clear‑cut narrative that D is most popular because it seems like it would be cost‑effective and perhaps because users have experience with that solution already, and so perhaps we can add functionality accordingly. But if our technical feasibility is quite low, that makes this project pretty risky. It means that our quality might not meet criteria. Using a weighted ranking approach allows us to discover this and see that instead solution A is the one that might prove most popular with solution D being the one that we will want to pursue if solution A were not one that we could move forward with for some reason. When things might be closer than this, we might want to judge each of these different elements side by side in order to arrive at a better understanding of how they relate to one another. Here comparing solutions A and D with each other again, we might decide that D actually better fits the needs of the organization, giving it a potential vote. When we compare solutions A and F, we may see that solution A is clearly the better of those two, while A and G, when compared with one another, would also favor A, giving it another vote of confidence. A and J might be related to each other next, but we discover in a bit of a surprise that we actually prefer J to A, and therefore we give it one vote in this matchup as well. Comparing D and F with one another, we may find that D is superior, giving it another vote. And when comparing D with G, we may discover that we actually think G is the better approach between those. This sort of pair‑matching system where we go back and forth comparing each option with each different option as a possibility allows us to gradually begin to understand how each of these different matters might rank and how each of these different solutions might interplay with one another. By going through this process, we can become much more comfortable with what our final results and decisions might be, understanding that once we've factored in all of these different metrics, we see that D and J might be our most popular approaches. But because we know that D has already surpassed J itself, we can rank D as our highest approach, giving it a score that allows us to move forward with confidence and understand what our contingency plans might be if we're not able to move forward with the best option for some reason. It's also possible that we may have to select from sets of possibilities rather than from simply one option alone. Here we see that there might be bundles of different possibilities that we have to consider with each other. When it comes to component A, we may have options 1 or 2. Same for components B, C, and D. And here we can determine which set of these out of the possible configurations would allow us to best meet our goals as well. Considering these sorts of elements, ensuring that we have our priorities straight, that we choose the best possible alternative for our work to move forward helps us in also considering what our quality criteria should be. And by making decisions like this effectively upfront, we can obviously put ourselves in a better chance to succeed from a quality perspective because we've already chosen solutions that best align with our organization's needs. And now we're left with the, well, not exactly simple, but straightforward matter of actually executing on that approach.

## Notes
Balancing costs and benefits is a critical aspect of quality management in project initiatives. Quality management involves making decisions about the level of quality required, the resources allocated to achieve it, and how to assess alternatives for achieving quality goals. Here are key points to consider regarding cost-benefit analysis and decision-making in quality management:

1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Cost-benefit analysis involves evaluating the trade-offs between the costs associated with achieving a certain level of quality and the benefits derived from that level of quality. This analysis helps in determining the scope and approach to quality management.

2. **Costs of Quality**: Remember that the costs of quality include prevention costs (investments in processes and practices to prevent defects), appraisal costs (costs associated with evaluating and assessing quality), and failure costs (costs incurred due to defects or non-conformance).

3. **Project Initiation**: Quality management begins at the project initiation stage. It involves defining quality criteria and assessing various alternative courses of action to meet quality objectives.

4. **Alternatives Analysis**: When evaluating alternatives, consider factors like the scope of action, feasibility, risks, and the expected value created by each option. The goal is to identify the most suitable solution.

5. **Criteria Weighting**: Use weighted matrices to assign percentage weightings to different factors or criteria. The criteria and weightings should align with project objectives and organizational priorities.

6. **Pair-Matching**: In situations where several options have similar scores, use pair-matching to compare each option with every other option. This helps in making more refined judgments and preferences.

7. **Stakeholder Consensus**: Ensure that key stakeholders are involved in the process of defining criteria, assigning weightings, and making decisions. Consensus among stakeholders is essential to align quality management efforts with project goals.

8. **No Action as an Option**: It's essential to recognize that, in some cases, the best course of action might be to take no action at all. This could be due to cost-effectiveness, high risks, or an inability to meet quality criteria with available options.

9. **Selecting the Best Alternative**: Based on the analysis, select the alternative that best aligns with project goals and quality criteria. This alternative should provide the highest overall benefit compared to its costs.

10. **Bundled Alternatives**: In some cases, you may have to select from sets of possibilities or bundled alternatives. Consider the combinations that best meet project objectives and quality standards.

11. **Execution**: Once the best alternative is selected, execute the chosen approach while adhering to the defined quality criteria. Monitor and assess quality throughout the project lifecycle to ensure compliance.

Effective quality management involves making informed decisions that balance costs and benefits to achieve the desired level of quality. By considering multiple factors, involving stakeholders, and using analytical tools, project teams can optimize their quality management efforts and increase the likelihood of project success.
