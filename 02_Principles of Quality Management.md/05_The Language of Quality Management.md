## The Language of Quality Management
```
As we continue our discussion of quality management, it's worth taking a moment to consider some of the language and terminology that we use when discussing quality management and how that will impact our further exploration of the topic. First, we need to understand the difference between costs of conformance and costs of non‑conformance within the project initiative. Costs of conformance are those that proactively focus on reducing failure in the first place. These are prevention costs that are incurred ensuring the creation of high‑quality results from the beginning. Appraisal costs are incurred searching for potential points of failure before delivery as well to ensure that we catch all the things that might be wrong, and we help to prevent things from going wrong in the first place. Costs of non‑conformance, on the other hand, are incurred when repairs, rework, loss of functionality, and other suboptimal outcomes result from lapses in our quality. Now we need to understand not only are direct costs like repairs and rework that we can place a number on, ones that we would consider in this category, but loss in functionality is really important too. If we create a tool that might be contractually sufficient to meet the customer's needs, but it's not reliable, it's extremely brittle, it's difficult to understand, it's not well‑designed, it's not terribly efficient, then we've not actually created a very good solution at all, have we? In this case, we have a loss of functionality for which it might be somewhat difficult to calculate a value, but represents a gap or deficit in the quality outcomes that we have been anticipating or should have been targeting. Internal failure costs or those that are incurred after discovery of flaws by the project team; whereas most non‑conformance costs also may fall into the external failure cost category, those being ones that are discovered by the customer after delivery has taken place. In either case, these are areas where we haven't lived up to the quality standards we've set or where our quality standards were not sufficient given what our goals for the project might be. It's important to also understand the difference between quality and grade as we discuss these. Quality means how well does the result fulfill its requirements? Something that's low quality in nature poorly meets the requirements that have been defined; whereas something that's high quality meets those requirements well or even exceeds them. Low quality is always a problem, regardless of the type of initiative we're undertaking. However, grade is something where more flexibility may exist. This is a measure of how sophisticated or refined the results of our effort might be. Something that's low grade is not very full‑featured or sophisticated; whereas something that is high grade is very full‑featured and sophisticated. Low grade, unlike low quality, is not always a problem. Let's look at some examples of how these might pair together. A high‑quality, high‑grade situation would be an application with many features, extraordinary reliability, and lack of bugs. Something that's high quality, but low grade would be an application that has few features, but also an extraordinary level of reliability and lack of bugs. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does great. Something that's low quality, but high grade would be an application with many features, but very poor reliability and many bugs; whereas something that's low quality and low grade might be the worst of all worlds where we have created something that can't do much and doesn't do it well either. Another example of something that's high quality and high grade would be an excellent smartphone. A high level of versatility and reliability, it can accomplish a lot of things, and it does it well. Something that's low quality, but high grade might be a cheaply made tablet where this could, in theory, accomplish a lot of tasks for us. But because it's not very enjoyable to use, it's not built well, it might be underpowered, not have a good battery life, all of these sorts of issues, it's not actually as useful as we might hope given what possibilities it entails. A high‑quality, low‑grade option might be a reliable, durable pen. This is not a very complicated operation. It's a pen, and we write with it. But it works perfectly. We love how it feels in our hand. It doesn't run out of ink or bleed betting very quickly. Something that's low quality and low grade might be a brittle pencil that, in theory, has a pretty simple job as well, allowing us to simply write some notes. But if the end is always breaking, if the eraser is made out of that really brittle type of rubber that doesn't do a good job of erasing at all and creates kind of that odd sound that squeaks when you try, it's terrible. This would be an example of a low‑quality, low‑grade result. Next, we want to discuss the differences between precision and accuracy as it comes to our ability to measure how high quality our results might be in our project work. Precision is a measure of how exact results might be, while accuracy is a measure of how correct the results might be. These terms are often interchanged, but we should be very careful in the way that we use them when we're discussing quality management. After all, this could be considered a very precise outcome where we have many different results all in the same area, but nowhere close to what our target might have entailed; whereas we could consider these to all be highly accurate results because they're pretty close to what we wanted to accomplish, but in fact, they're nowhere close to one another. So it indicates that there's not a level of high precision here. We look at four more examples of high precision and high accuracy where we are really centered up on that bullseye there, where we have high precision but low accuracy where all of our shots are still very nicely congregated together, but nowhere close to what our initial target might have been, a level of low precision and high accuracy where we are roughly the same amount away from our target each time, but the direction from which we are away from that target is different, and then low precision and low accuracy where we're really just all over the place. Different projects may call for higher or lower grades, but always require high quality. Accurate results may be required when precise results are not required. And more rarely, there may be times where highly precise, but less accurate results may suffice as well. Rather than thinking of a target, think now about creating a system of nuts and bolts that we're going to use in order to assemble a new aircraft design. Now it might be extremely important they were accurate in making sure that all of our results are the exact same and that those results are in line with what our specifications might have been. Or it might be based on these parts that as long as they are precise that they're able to align these nuts and bolts with each other. If they're slightly outside of our conforming definition for the exact diameter or length of each of these, so long as they still pair together, then that would be okay. So understanding the differences between precision and accuracy and which is actually most valuable for your project outcomes is something worth considering while creating your quality management plans.

## Notes
In the context of quality management, it's essential to distinguish between several key concepts and terminologies:

1. **Costs of Conformance vs. Costs of Non-Conformance**:
   - **Costs of Conformance** are expenses incurred proactively to ensure high-quality results from the beginning. These include prevention costs (preventing issues) and appraisal costs (searching for potential issues before delivery).
   - **Costs of Non-Conformance** are incurred when failures, repairs, rework, or loss of functionality result from lapses in quality. Internal failure costs occur before customer delivery, while external failure costs are discovered by the customer after delivery.

2. **Quality vs. Grade**:
   - **Quality** refers to how well a result fulfills its requirements. High quality means it meets or exceeds requirements, while low quality means it poorly meets requirements.
   - **Grade** measures the sophistication or refinement of the results. High grade implies a more sophisticated product, while low grade suggests a less refined product.

   Examples:
   - High Quality, High Grade: An excellent smartphone with many features and reliability.
   - High Quality, Low Grade: A reliable, simple pen.
   - Low Quality, High Grade: A cheap tablet with potential but poor usability.
   - Low Quality, Low Grade: A brittle, ineffective pencil.

3. **Precision vs. Accuracy**:
   - **Precision** measures how exact and consistent results are. It focuses on the tightness of clustering.
   - **Accuracy** measures how close results are to the target or true value. It focuses on correctness.

   Examples:
   - High Precision, High Accuracy: Results are tightly clustered around the target.
   - High Precision, Low Accuracy: Results are tightly clustered but far from the target.
   - Low Precision, High Accuracy: Results are spread out but consistently close to the target.
   - Low Precision, Low Accuracy: Results are scattered and far from the target.

These concepts are crucial for understanding and evaluating the quality of project outcomes, as they help project teams and stakeholders assess the effectiveness and reliability of the results. The choice between precision and accuracy may depend on the specific project requirements and goals. High-quality results are always essential, but the level of grade, precision, and accuracy required can vary based on project needs.
