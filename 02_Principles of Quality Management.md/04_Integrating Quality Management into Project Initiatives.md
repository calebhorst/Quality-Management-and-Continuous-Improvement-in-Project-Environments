## Integrating Quality Management into Project Initiatives
```
As we think about how we can integrate quality management into our project initiatives, there are a variety of factors that we should consider. These include customer satisfaction, management responsibility, continuous improvement, prevention over inspection, and cost of quality. Let's look at each of these in more detail, first, beginning with customer satisfaction. What does our customer expect from our work on the project? How do they expect us to conduct ourselves while project work continues? And what do they anticipate will be the result of our work? What does the customer actually need? And how does that align with where their expectations have been set? What agreements have been made that might outline quality criteria that we must adhere to in our work? Our requirements that we develop in association with our customers should be understood, defined, evaluated, and managed in nature. It's critical that we have a shared understanding of what the requirements for our project work should be and that we've created definitions for which there is a joint consensus between the project team and the customer, such that we can then evaluate those to ensure that we have met quality criteria. During this time, it's important, of course, for us to manage, not only the work of the project, but also our relationship with the customers to ensure that we understand what that criteria should be, if there are changes to our customer needs that should result in revisions to our requirements, and so forth. This ties in directly with management responsibility, defining quality criteria and guidelines should take place prior to our project work beginning. It's important for us to know what our target should be before we formally commit to undertaking that work otherwise we'll be rudderless, without direction, not understanding what it is exactly we are supposed to be accomplishing. Note that this is a little bit different in agile environments, in particular, where we may begin our work by experimenting and by exploring to see what possibilities might in fact exist out there, but this process can help us in creating the quality criteria necessary as we continue to move our work forward. As project leaders, it's important for us to lead by example and to uphold our quality standards, to monitor the quality of our work and results, and to coordinate any necessary revisions to our quality management approach based on our results so far and the feedback of our stakeholders, both on the project team and with the customer and elsewhere. We should seek to continuously improve on our quality approach. A cycle of plan, do, check, act can drive improvement efforts taking place. This is something that we'll discuss in greater detail in the final module of this course. In addition, total quality management, Six Sigma, and other methodologies may also be useful to consider as part of our continuous improvement efforts as they allow us to sharpen our focus on quality and on our ability to execute high quality outcomes. Prevention over inspection comes next. Being able to plan, design, and build quality into the entire project allows us to ensure that quality efforts come to be based on the work that we undertake, not based on us having to continue a cycle of refinement and wasted resources after our work has been done. After all, preventing mistakes is less costly than correcting them later, and it's not just a matter of resource expenditure and additional time. Not being able to create a quality outcome from the outset results in being able to create a higher quality outcome from the outset, results in lower risk and higher satisfaction from our stakeholders, who will be impressed with the level of work that we've been able to undertake. Cost of quality comes next. This includes all quality‑related expenses, including our cost in preventing issues from taking place in the first place, in assessing conformance to our quality criteria, and both internal and external failure, as well as rework of any substandard results that we encounter. Internal failures are those that we catch while still completing the work on the project team, while external failures are those that might not be found or discovered until our customers come about them. It's the difference between having to fix things before delivery and completing the equivalent of warranty work after we've already shipped off our product. All of these different types of dimensions factor into the costs of quality that we encounter, so it may feel like we're spending a significant amount of resources upfront as part of our quality management efforts. But if they save us a significant amount of trouble on the backend, having to provide additional support or warranty work for our project's results, then we might find that our net cost is much lower by making sure that our quality focus is sufficient during project work itself. Now, there are different levels of quality management that we can undertake, ranging from a least effective and most passive approach up to those that are most effective and potentially most efficient in nature. Customer‑driven quality management is our least preferable option where we take no active approach to quality management, and we leave the assessment of our work to the customer themselves. Now, this leads to a variety of different negative effects, including the warranty claims that we've mentioned before, recalls, the need for rework to take place, as well as a diminishment of our reputation as our customer learns that we simply can't be trusted to deliver based on the sort of requirements that we've laid out. Afterall, if we're not verifying that we've actually done the job they asked us to do and we're leaving it purely for them to decide that, what actually is guiding our day‑to‑day work? If we're not making sure that we're meeting our requirements, how do we even know what to work on next? This is where detect and correct comes in as a moderate improvement to the situation. In this case, quality management takes place after initial work has been completed, so we create something in its entirety to the best of our abilities based on our existing criteria, but we don't undertake any testing or verification until that work has been completed. Problems are then identified before delivery to the customer for the most part, making this better than nothing, but still too reactive for most projects, given that we are not actually finding a way to fix anything midstream as we continue development work. This is where quality assurance comes in. Applying quality management both to the results of the work, as well as to the project processes themselves that create the work leads to much better outcomes. It helps to prevent teams from encountering the same issues repeatedly through a higher level of proactivity. Consider, if we're using a detect and correct method and we are only ever addressing quality issues once the work has already been completed, however will we go back and fix our processes to help to ensure those quality issues don't arise in the first place? This is what assuring quality is about. Incorporating quality takes this a step further. Quality management is now integrated into our project planning and process development from the outset. This helps to ensure a holistic approach to quality management exists within the project environment. Here, we're not only introducing a process and then making improvements to it as we see what goes wrong, but instead, we're thinking and anticipating upfront how we can build out our processes and build out our methods of accomplishing project objectives, such that we don't face quality issues and are able to promote a high level of quality in the first place. This leads to our final and most effective level, which is fostering a quality culture within the team and within the organization at large. This helps to ensure that there is an understanding of the importance of quality management that transcends our team, and it results in a greater level of buy‑in and commitment from stakeholders and key executives. In organizations that don't value quality, you may encounter resistance because it seems like we're spending an awful lot of additional time and resources upfront checking our work and perhaps being too conservative or judicious in our approach. By developing an understanding of the value that's added, by undertaking these quality measures while our work continues, and while we're planning out our work, and while we're even thinking about what type of initiatives we might undertake, we can understand then that our net benefit of quality management at an active level is far higher than what our end cost might be if we don't take a serious look at what our quality should look like. If we're just creating our work in a very shoddy and haphazard manner, then we're going to find that we spend a lot of time fixing our mistakes, disappointing customers, not even having access or the possibility of certain opportunities because our level of quality doesn't allow us to execute at that kind of level. All of these sorts of costs are going to be incurred one way or another. We can either incur them in ensuring quality outcomes, or we can incur them because we haven't put our time and effort necessary into thinking about our approach to quality. While the choice is up to your project team, surely putting in the time and effort to ensure high quality outcomes beats paying the price on the back end for not doing so.

## Notes
Key points for integrating quality management into project initiatives:

1. **Customer Satisfaction**: Understand and align with customer expectations, needs, and quality criteria. Develop a shared understanding of project requirements.

2. **Management Responsibility**: Quality criteria and guidelines should be defined before project work begins. Project leaders must lead by example, uphold quality standards, and coordinate revisions based on results and feedback.

3. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement a cycle of plan, do, check, act to drive continuous improvement. Consider methodologies like Total Quality Management and Six Sigma.

4. **Prevention over Inspection**: Plan, design, and build quality into the project to prevent issues from occurring in the first place. This approach is more cost-effective and efficient.

5. **Cost of Quality**: Includes expenses related to preventing issues, assessing conformance, internal and external failure, and rework. Preventing issues upfront can significantly reduce these costs.

6. **Levels of Quality Management**: 
   - Customer-Driven Quality Management (Least Effective): Quality assessment is left to the customer, leading to various negative consequences.
   - Detect and Correct: Quality management takes place after work completion but before customer delivery.
   - Quality Assurance: Quality management is applied to both project processes and results, helping prevent recurring issues.
   - Incorporating Quality: Quality management is integrated into project planning and process development from the beginning.
   - Fostering a Quality Culture (Most Effective): A culture of quality is established within the team and the organization, emphasizing the importance of quality management.

Establishing a culture of quality and proactively managing quality from the outset of a project leads to higher overall project success and lower costs in the long run.
