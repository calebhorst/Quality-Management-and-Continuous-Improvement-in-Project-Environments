## Module Introduction
```
Welcome back. With a firm understanding of quality principles under our belts, in this module, we're going to look at how you can begin to assemble a strategy for managing quality in your initiative. We'll begin by looking at the components of standard quality management plans, things that you should think about in assembling your strategy for how quality will be managed. Then, we'll look at quality planning in context, how your qualityâ€‘related plans may interrelate and integrate with other portions of our project planning as well. From there, we'll look at how you can tailor quality plans to the needs of your individual initiative and some of the specific concepts and questions that you should think about when determining how to shape your plan to best meet your specific needs. Then, we'll look at some of the considerations that agile teams should take into account when considering quality management as their project work begins and as it continues through a variety of sprints and iterations. Let's get started.
