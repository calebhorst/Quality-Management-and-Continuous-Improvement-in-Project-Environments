## Tailoring Quality Plans to Initiative Needs
```
As we pull together our quality‑related plans, there are some components that will help us in tailoring what those plans look like in any project environment. First, what does the auditing and compliance situation look like within your organization or for the type of project that you're undertaking? Quality plans should accommodate expected audit and complaints practices within the organization. Now these might be ones that are internal based on your organization itself, or it could involve a series of formal checkpoints, during which you meet with the customer and they approve the work that you've done so far. This is particularly the case when working on complex projects that have extensive contracts such as government procurement, for example, where we may have multiple stages to go through during our project's work, at which point we have to get a sign off for our work to continue, or it could be a relatively informal process of the project sponsor stopping by just to see how things are going. In either case, we should plan for these, and know what we're going to need to be able to present, and roughly when we're going to wish to present it, such that we can ensure that our quality efforts help to facilitate that presentation taking place. In many cases, audits can provide us with an opportunity to come into contact with these sorts of tools and templates, as well as any existing perspective they may have to offer. This is really a two‑way street. In an ideal situation, these sorts of audits can be very constructive, not simply a matter of someone coming in to officiate and tell you what you've done wrong, but rather to share their wisdom and their perspective on perhaps what you've gotten right or what you could do to improve on your design based on their perspective so far. They may have an extensive amount of experience in this area, which is how they ended up in this compliance or auditing kind of role. They may have that perspective that includes knowledge that is foreign to you, about areas that can impact the project, but aren't necessarily on your radar, or for which you don't have that much experience. Or they might quite simply, be the customer, and no one understands the customer's perspective better than the customer themselves. They can still help to shape what direction your work should go in moving forward based on those preferences. We spoke about industry standards earlier, something to consider in our compliance and quality plans more broadly, but also, we can consider these in the ways that we tailor our plan and where we focus our efforts in crafting our quality‑related strategies. Industry quality standards may be mandatory or simply desirable to meet. Customer requirements may also guide our quality approach, while government and regulatory constraints must be considered here as well. In addition to these kinds of industry standards that should help to frame and shape our quality plans, we should also have an eye on our ability to continue to improve moving forward. After all, a commitment to quality includes a commitment to continuous improvement. The quality of our results,as well as our processes may both be subject to such improvement efforts taking place. In the next module, we'll discuss in greater detail how you can apply continuous improvement to your quality management efforts. Last, stakeholder engagement should also be considered as part of tailoring our quality plans. The extent of stakeholder involvement during project work may dictate when and how much quality planning should be undertaken. If we meet with stakeholders often to gain their feedback, we perhaps don't need to put quite as much time in creating a comprehensive plan for how quality will be managed because we are closer to that source of feedback, we're able to intuit more regularly whether we're heading in the right direction or not. Whereas if we create a very complex contract and then go off to work in a vacuum before delivering a finished product to a customer, we better have a very good idea of what it is we're seeking to create. Close collaboration with suppliers is also often key to quality management for the same reason. If we don't provide necessary context to that supplier, they won't be aware of what our quality standards are and the context of why those standards exist. Similarly, if we don't speak with them and collaborate on a regular basis, we may lose alignment regarding what our quality priorities might be. Things could change on our end, and if we don't communicate those effectively, they simply won't know that the quality standards have changed. So making sure that we feed through any advice or feedback that we receive from the customer to our other partners working with us on the initiative is just as important as capturing that perspective ourselves

## Notes
1. **Auditing and Compliance**: Consider your organization's auditing and compliance practices, including both internal processes and formal checkpoints with customers. Plan for these events, know what you need to present, and ensure your quality efforts facilitate these presentations.

2. **Audits as Learning Opportunities**: Audits can be constructive and provide valuable perspectives. Auditors may have extensive experience, knowledge, or the customer's viewpoint, all of which can shape your project positively.

3. **Industry Standards**: Consider industry quality standards, which may be mandatory or desirable. Customer requirements and government/regulatory constraints should also guide your quality approach.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: Commit to continuous improvement in both results and processes. Quality management should include a dedication to ongoing enhancement.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Tailor your quality plans based on stakeholder engagement levels. Frequent stakeholder interactions may require less comprehensive quality planning, while close collaboration with suppliers is crucial for maintaining quality alignment. Communication of feedback and changes in quality standards is essential for all project partners.
