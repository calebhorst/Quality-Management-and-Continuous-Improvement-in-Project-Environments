## Quality Planning in Context
```
Of course, our quality‑related aspirations can't be captured entirely in a vacuum. There are a variety of different perspectives from which a successful project manager must consider the various dimensions of their initiative. Some of the associated project plans that tie most closely into our quality management efforts include, of course, our requirements management plan, which captures not only our requirements, but how we go about capturing those requirements in the first place. We need to know what we actually seek to accomplish so that we can set some definitions regarding what we would consider successfully completing that. Our risk management plan is important as well. After all, subpar quality is one of the most critical ways that we can end up in a risky situation regarding our project work. If we are indeed meeting our quality criteria, we help to reduce risk. However, some risks may also impact our ability to deliver on our quality goals. And so understanding the back‑and‑forth interplay that exists here is very valuable for the holistic project manager. A stakeholder engagement plan helps us to understand whom we might turn to while creating our quality‑related requirements on the project. Understanding what they expect, what their definition of success might be, how they will actually use the product that we create, and so forth can all help us in guiding and shaping what our quality definitions should be. Finally, our project scope baseline also tells us what the full range of project activities are that must be underneath the domain of our quality‑related planning as well. By cross‑referencing our scope baseline, we may easily determine that certain areas are going to be developed, or at least that's the plan, but we haven't created any quality criteria associated with them yet. Similarly, we may have created quality criteria in the past for a component that no longer is considered part of our scope baseline. If so, that criteria should be removed lest it cause us to undertake work that's not actually within scope for the project. A variety of project documents also may impact our quality planning. An assumptions log quite simply captures those assumptions that we've made in our project planning. This can be very important because if one of these assumptions proves not to be true, it may greatly impact our project and our quality‑related plans. Our defined requirements outline where our quality metrics and criteria should be focused. Requirements traceability helps us to ensure we understand who is responsible and therefore where our quality criteria should be targeted. Our risk register indicates those areas where the project may run into challenges or conflicts that might interfere with our quality approach. And our stakeholder register indicates all of those who might be impacted or have an impact on our project work that should be considered in crafting our quality plans and in executing our quality management efforts. Several environmental factors may impact our quality management efforts as well. What regulatory, industry, or organization regulations, rules, and standards might apply to our work or end results? Regardless of what our quality standards might be interior to the project team, there may be other quality standards that we must meet or exceed that exist outside of the project bounds. This is important because it can exist not only within the broader context of our organization, but also at multiple levels of government. Other standards might be optional in nature, but greatly influence the perception of our product on the market at large or for the customer that we're seeking to serve. For example, if we're a construction company building the new headquarters for a client, they may care greatly if there is a certification that is earned by that building for things such as energy efficiency or the sustainable nature of the material that was used in its construction. These may not be legal requirements or even regulatory per se, but instead they outline a framework of requirements that are important to our customer, even though they don't originate from the customer directly. How might geographic distribution of work or our supply chain impact our quality management efforts? Oftentimes, especially on more complex projects where quality management is most essential, we won't have all of the activity and action taking place under one roof. Rather, we'll be working with a series of different partners. We'll be working on the project from multiple locations. And making sure that our quality criteria are able to capture this and our quality management strategy is able to execute on those criteria becomes all the more important. If we are not able to verify that components from a supplier meet our standards before implementing them into our work, that quite frankly becomes our problem then when we seek to turn this around to a customer who might find that it simply doesn't perform in the manner that they anticipated. For example, if we manufacture cell phones and we contract out with a company to create the battery for those phones, our customer won't care if the battery manufacturer did a good job or not. They'll blame us if their battery life is poor. As such, we have to understand that we are the center point for quality management taking place even when working with other partners. Can we create operating conditions and working environments that help to promote our quality‑related efforts? This is certainly helpful when it comes to working with these external partners, but also just as essential in guiding the actions and the mindset of our team within the organization. By crafting this quality‑first mindset within our team and allowing that to spread within our company at large, we can help to create an environment where quality is something that is proactive in nature rather than something that's only dealt with reactively if we fall well below a critical threshold of some sort that's easily defined. Associated with this is our fourth factor, which is how our organizational structure and culture shape our quality management. It's incumbent on us as leaders in a project, whether we may formally hold that title or if we are a team member seeking to exhibit leadership qualities to our peers, to place quality high on our list of priorities, understanding the cascading effects that not paying sufficient attention to quality can have on our ability to otherwise be successful on the project. What marketplace conditions may influence our quality mindset as well? This could come back to things like industry certifications that might be important to customers to see, customer satisfaction rankings that provides social proof to other future customers that we actually are doing a good job, that we're offering a high‑quality product, and so forth. And there might be expectations based on what competitors have already offered in this market that set either a floor or, in some cases, a ceiling to our quality management efforts. If we're working in the field that's deeply commoditized, then we must either find a way to differentiate our product, or we may find that our quality management efforts can only get us so far. If we have created the very best of something, but that's not really a high priority for the consumer of this item, then we should probably curtail our quality plans to be more realistically aligned with our market. Alternatively, if quality is of paramount importance to our customers in the marketplace at large, it makes it all the more important for our quality planning to be meticulous and comprehensive in nature. A variety of organizational assets can also impact our planning approach. Quality management policies, procedures, and guidelines might already exist within your organization. If so, this is great. You can leverage what's already there. You know what some of the expectations are going to be. And oftentimes, these will be followed by a variety of quality‑related tooling and templates being in place already as well. These may also be leveraged and adapted in order to assist in your quality management efforts. Finally, historical data, organizational wisdom, and any lessons that have been learned in the past and have been captured for us to learn from, either on our own initiative in earlier phases or on projects the organization has undertaken in the past, can all help us to understand where we might need to focus our quality efforts, where there were failures and where there were successes in the past and how we can refine our approach to learn from the best examples of all of these.
