## Module Review
```
Let's take a moment to review. Quality management plans should be tailored to fit the needs and priorities of the organization and the initiative in question. The approach that's taken regarding quality will impact a variety of other dimensions of the project as well. And so considering those other dimensions, such as how we manage our scope, how we manage risk, our engagement with stakeholders, our procurement relationships, and so forth can all help to influence the ways that we might craft a quality management strategy that best fits our needs. Our approach to quality should take into account auditing and compliance, industry standards, the nature of stakeholder engagement, as well as continuous improvement efforts. We want to be sure that we're ready to defend our quality management efforts in case of an audit or compliance. Not in a legal or court kind of sense, but rather in that we should welcome the challenge as healthy, being able to share with other perspectives what our take on the matter is and being able to learn from what feedback they might be able to provide to us as well. We can often leverage industry standards or use them as a framework for some of our other quality management priorities to be put in the place, and we can also do the same with the engagement that we received from stakeholders. But we should understand how those stakeholders we might collaborate with closely would result in a different type of quality management than those situations where we might only speak with our stakeholders near the very beginning and end of project work. Always, we should be seeking to improve on our efforts as time goes on, especially where quality assurance is concerned, given that we can continue improving our processes and resulting in a higher level of quality creation rather than having to address and repair things after the fact. Agile teams may leverage quality efforts into continuous improvement more rapidly than traditional teams, which is a great asset that they should take advantage of. Given that we can simply accomplish a high level of quality by staying true to agile principles also helps to ensure that our results can meet and exceed expectations. If we remain focused on value, if we remain committed to collaborating with the customer, if we remain focused on taking the simplest path to value creation at all times, then we will find that quality is inherently embedded into our approach. We've already used it as a compass in helping to fulfill our commitment to these agile principles. In the next module though, we'll dive deeper, looking at continuous improvement more closely and also how we can assess the quality challenges that we might face on the project such that we can ensure that our goals are achieved and our commitment to stakeholders can shine through. I'll look forward to seeing you then.
