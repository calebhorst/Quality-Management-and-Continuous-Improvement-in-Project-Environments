## Components of Quality Management Plans
```
Just as it's important for us to determine what our quality criteria will be before embarking on our work, it's important for us to also simply define what our quality‑related requirements are going to be and describe how these standards will be met and verified in the first place. This quality management plan of sorts serves as a compass for quality efforts throughout the project initiative. This planning should take place concurrently with other kinds of project planning as well. So we should be considering our quality‑related strategy at the same time that we are considering our risk, the scope of the project, the cost, the schedule or time that we're going to have available to us to complete this work or other contractual requirements, how we'll deal with stakeholders and communicate and so forth. Through all of these different elements, we can arrive at a quality management plan that can help to guide our quality efforts regardless of what our project methodology might be. This plan should include a few different key components, even though the details will vary from project to project. While the details of your quality plan will vary, of course, based on the specifics of your initiative, there are a few key components that we should almost always consider in creating such a plan. First are our standards for quality. Of course, we need to outline what we actually expect from a quality perspective of the work that we're going to undertake, both in the ways that we conduct our project processes and also in our results. We may set these on a objective‑by‑objective basis, but we may also have some principles and baselines that we follow for almost all of our work. Quality objectives should be outlined here as well, defining exactly what it is we seek to achieve. These will line back up with the requirements that our project is expected to fulfill such that we can verify that those requirements indeed had been fulfilled correctly. Roles and responsibilities related to quality management should be included here as well. This could include defining which team members might be responsible for quality assurance and quality control efforts, who might be responsible for setting quality requirements in the first place and ensuring that they are upheld, who might help to guide the team through continuous improvement from a quality perspective, and so on. Any review processes that we may employ as part of our project work may also be described here, helping us to better understand how we'll assess the quality nature of our approach to project work over time and helping to guide our continuous improvement efforts. The specifics of any quality assurance activities that we might undertake to ensure as our work continues that we are upholding our quality standards. Quality control activities should be defined as well, how we're going to verify once our work has been completed on any given project component that we indeed have met our quality criteria. What quality tools and processes we might rely on, such as how we actually measure that quality. What sort of performance reports we might create in order to conduct quality analysis and so on should be contemplated here as well. In addition, any contingency and corrective procedures that we can premeditate should be included here too. If we know that there might be a potential for a quality‑related failure to take place, how will we address that? What is our process if we've already delivered a component to the customer and we receive a warranty claim or feedback that something needs to be addressed? Depending up when we are in our project life cycle might also impact what this procedure should look like. But thinking about it in advance means that we'll never be caught unaware if issues arise in the future. This really strikes at the heart of what quality management is all about. Thinking about those things that could go wrong and how we'd address them and thinking about how we can keep things from going wrong and make sure that we meet our guidelines and our aspirations as our work continues. Now the level of formality and detail that is associated with this quality planning should suit the project's needs and the organization's desires. No single style or structure that best fits every initiative exists. Rather, this is something to be tailored to the individual needs of your project and of your project methodology. An agile team should absolutely put in time thinking about these sorts of issues in advance even before their work begins. But the exact quality criteria they use to judge their work might not be defined until each individual sprint is about to begin taking place. This, of course, helps us to leverage the value of agile where we're determining what would be most valuable to work on next and finalizing our definitions of that work right before work begins. In a more waterfall predictive environment, we may wish to have a more comprehensive quality plan in place, especially if our organizational culture highly values aspiring to a level of quality in our work, as well as reducing risk and ensuring that there's a more predictable outcome. In any case, quality plans should be reviewed regularly in order to ensure that we are actually adhering to those useful guidelines that we've defined in advance for ourselves and to verify that our quality plans remain adequate and relevant to the overall needs of the project.
