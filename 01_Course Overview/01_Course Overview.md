## Course Overview
```
Hi, everyone. My name is Casey Ayers, and welcome to my course, Quality Management and Continuous Improvement in Project Environments. Unless we are able to define and uphold quality standards, our hard work on project initiatives is not likely to yield the value we seek to create. In this course, you'll learn what makes quality management so essential to effective project management. First, you'll gain exposure to the principles of quality management and the core terminology and concepts used to think about quality‑related issues in project initiatives. Next, you'll learn how to tailor a quality management strategy to your organization and project's specific needs. Finally, you'll discover how to apply your new knowledge and a suite of relevant techniques to assess quality‑related challenges and find new ways to continuously improve your team's approach. By the end of this course, you'll understand what makes quality management so central to effective project initiatives and how you can develop and deploy a strategy of your own to ensure your project's success. Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with some of the principles of project management in general in order to better relate to the material we'll discuss. This course is part of several series here at Pluralsight, including our series on project management, which can help you prepare for the PMP and other certification exams, as well as our Agile Transformation for Leaders and Team Members series. This course can also help you earn continuing education credits toward project management certifications, like PMP, and is a great resource for you, even if you're just looking to learn more about project management. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how you can ensure your project team generates high quality results with Quality Management and Continuous Improvement in Project Environments, here at Pluralsight.
