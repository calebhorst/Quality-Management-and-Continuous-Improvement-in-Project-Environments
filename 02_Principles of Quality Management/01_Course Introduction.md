## Course Introduction
```
Hello, and welcome. I'm Casey Ayers, and this is Quality Management and Continuous Improvement in Project Environments. This course is part of a few different series here at Pluralsight. It can be useful if you're trying to learn more about the principles of project management or if you're studying for your PMP Project Management Professional exam. It can also be useful if you're studying to earn the CompTIA Project+ certification or if you're looking to earn a PMI‑CAPM Certified Associate in Project Management. This course is also part of our Agile Transformation for Leaders and our Agile Transformation for Team Members paths because quality management is such a central concept in each of these important disciplines. In this course, we'll start by first gaining an understanding of the quality‑related terms and principles that we need to understand in order to discuss these sorts of concepts that we'll cover throughout the course. Then, we'll discover the value of a quality‑focused mindset in project initiatives, why keeping value first in mind is so important to ensuring that our objectives are met and maximum value is created from our effort. Then, we'll look at how we can develop a quality management approach that's aligned with your project goals and methodology, allowing you to tailor your efforts and your focus in quality planning to those areas of greatest importance to your initiative and organization. After that, we'll learn how data analysis and visualization techniques can facilitate quality management, allowing you to better harness data, better understand the performance of your project, and gain a better understanding of what you can do moving forward to continue to improve. That's what we'll cover in our final objective where we connect quality management with continuous improvement efforts, looking at how we can continue to build on what we've gained here such that the quality of not only our work and our output of our work, but also the processes that we use to create that output continue to get better and better over time. We'll look at these objectives in three different modules, beginning with the Principles of Quality Management, followed by Developing a Quality Management Strategy, and wrapping up with Continuous Improvement and Assessing Quality Challenges. In this first module, we're going to cover a lot of important information. We'll begin with how you can apply project principles to quality management. Then, we'll look at the quality mindset and how we can approach our projects with quality first in mind. Then, we'll look at how we can integrate quality management into our project initiatives. After that, we'll look at the consequences of poor quality management, how we can measure and analyze quality to ensure that the work that we are doing actually lines up to standards that allow us to achieve the greatest level of value. Then, we'll look at how we can prioritize our quality management efforts while also juggling all of the other important factors that project leaders have to deal with within any initiative. I'm looking forward to going through this material with you, and I'm glad that you joined me. Let's jump right in.
