## Applying Project Principles to Quality Management
```
In each course of this series, we spend some time up front looking at a few of the principles that should guide our work is project leaders regardless of the methodology that we might approach a project with, the size of the project, or even what we're trying to accomplish. In each case, we have some shared values that we can turn back to, and the first of those is, well, to focus on value itself. Quality and value are inherently tied. If we spend time creating a solution of some sort, but it's of low quality, then we're not going to be able to achieve the sort of yield in value that we set out for in the first place. Our underlying needs are always best addressed when our quality goals are achieved or exceeded. If we come in below those, we simply have not created something for our end user, our customer, perhaps even just our project sponsor that offers the value that was initially foreseen and envisioned when we began on our work. Managing system interactions is part and parcel with work that project managers have to undertake on a daily basis as well. Considering the role of the project within the broader ecosystem of the organization or within the broader context of other projects that might be associated with our work, and the role of each action within the project enhances the outcome quality that we are able to achieve. By thinking in this context, we can better understand the consequences of each different decision that we might make, how we prioritize our resources, how we define certain requirements, how we'll be able to integrate together the work that we do here with what already exists in the organization with what might come in the future, as well as with other project initiatives that might be underway concurrently to our work. We have to recognize and address complexity. The selection of quality measurement methods becomes more difficult as the complexity of our project grows. After all, if we're working on something quite simple, it's easy to define what we are trying to achieve, and therefore it's fairly easy to define what our quality criteria might look like. On the other hand, if we're creating something that's very complex, that involves many different parts and components, a lot of different functionality, a wide range of potential users and so forth, then the work that we have to do in defining our quality criteria will also become more complex. Think about the difference between developing a simple pencil as opposed to developing and operating system for a new kind of tablet. The pencil either writes or it doesn't. It's either useful and the easy to hold and does a good job of not breaking or it doesn't. Whereas with the operating system, it may do quite well in some tasks, but we could have some instability or some crashes during certain types of tasks that certain users might undertake. Have we met our quality criteria overall because these are considered to be edge cases that are perhaps not even important enough to address? Or are these critical to the underlying function of our work? Use of techniques like root cause analysis increases in value in these complex environments because we can gain an understanding of why things might be going awry, why we might not be meeting the quality criteria that we've set out with, and how we can solve the sort of underlying problems that may cascade later into other symptoms of quality issues if we are not able to address them now. Enabling and facilitating change is central to what we undertake as members of project teams. And, after all, quality outcomes are themselves facilitators of change. The work that we do on the project is to create something new, and if we do a good job and create something of high quality, then we allow our organization, our customer, or whomever the recipient of our work might be to evolve. Ensuring project work is handed over in a high‑quality manner also helps to enable this transformation. Think about it. We might create something that's truly magnificent, offers an incredible amount of functionality, and is unparalleled by any similar solution. But if our end user doesn't know how to use it, then it won't actually accomplish anything at all. And so ensuring that we offer either the documentation or the training or simply the context necessary to actually gain the potential yield from the solution that we've created helps to ensure that we actually achieve the level of quality that we've set out for. We must exhibit adaptability and resiliency as members of project teams. Quality metrics may also need to adapt as our project goals and work shift. Note that this is different than simply moving the goalposts on our work because things might not be going the way that we'd like them to. It's very important to always question whether or not changing our quality criteria is in the best interest of the project. In some cases, our understanding of what we are seeking to create is enhanced to a degree that we need to revisit this criteria. But that's very different from falling short of our initial goals and simply giving up or retreating to a lower level of acceptable quality. High‑quality outcomes are themselves definitionally more resilient in nature, and this is very important as well. Solutions that are able to create the correct type of output some of the time are useful, well, some of the time. But if we can't rely on them, then they become very degraded in the amount of real‑world value that they can offer. Creating things that are resilient, that are able to help users beyond any complications they might have, are able to work through uncertainty or without exhibiting errors is itself a degree of quality that we can measure. We have to address opportunities and threats as members of project teams as well, and poor quality outcomes increase the threat of project failure or underperformance taking place. Risk tolerance is no excuse for inadequate quality management planning. Rather, we may think very explicitly and intentionally that we are willing to accept a certain degree of quality being met that might be lower than another team. Risk tolerance is no excuse for inadequate quality management. This is something that we must always consider intentionally, even if we decide that we are okay with an outcome that might be of a lesser grade of quality, that might have a lower level of uptime or resiliency or functionality because it's not a high priority for the organization or because our risk appetite allows for it. But we have to think about that matter and create quality criteria that still align with what our vision for that project component might be. This goes hand in hand with being a good steward within the organization, within the project team, and in how the project team interacts with the broader world at large. Quality results take into consideration the resources and effort that are expended in the creation of our project's goals. Achieving the necessary quality to meet project goals is a matter of care and respect itself as well. If we care about our end users or our customers, whomever might benefit from our work, then we have a responsibility to try and create an outcome of high quality that can serve their needs, as well as we are able to muster. Tailoring our approach to the context of the project can help in our quality management efforts as well. Our quality metrics should be tailored to meet customer expectations and needs. And while the grade of the product may vary, as we'll discuss a little later on, quality aspirations should always be high. Just because what we're working on may be more or less sophisticated and complex doesn't mean that it's okay to have a lower level of quality than we might otherwise achieve. We may seek to create something very simple, but if we do a good job of it, it still represents a high level of quality, even if our ambitions were fairly modest. We should seek to understand the stakeholders that are related to our project as well. And remember, this includes not only those who we may perceive as being impacted by the project or by our project work, but also those who perceive themselves as being impacted by our work as well. Desired level of quality and how we measure quality is up to the stakeholder perspective at the end of the day. After all, we're not accomplishing this work purely out of boredom or for our own interests, but rather we're conducting this project for the benefit of someone else. Perhaps we're developing a new sort of vehicle at an automotive company. Well, the quality is going to be judged by the marketplace. Perhaps we're creating a new piece of software that we're going to release onto a mobile app store. We'll get some indication of quality based on reviews, number of downloads, the revenue that we're able to drive, and so forth. Or perhaps we're just creating something for an internal team that theoretically should make their job easier or help them to be more productive. Well, if they're not more productive, if they don't adapt our solution, or we see other measures that indicate that we've not met these quality goals, then the verdict is in. We simply haven't done a quality job for our stakeholders. Our work needs to align to the quality standards and measurements that matter most to stakeholders because that's the gauge by which we will be judged. As project leaders, a central portion of our role is to motivate and coach our team members. Commitment to quality needs to be exemplified by project leaders themselves in order for this to become a standard within the overall culture of our project team. Coaching and development should help others to understand what the costs are of subpar work, not just the explicit and easy‑to‑see costs, perhaps having to redo the work or not being able to meet the contract, but also those that are more hidden, such as instilling doubt into the relationship between us and the stakeholders that matter most, reducing the morale of our project team as they feel less capable of achieving their goals, and so forth. Fostering accountability and respect goes hand in hand with these coaching and development efforts. Meeting quality criteria is necessary in being held and in holding ourselves accountable for the work that we undertake. Quality results earn respect and trust from clients, customers, and sponsors, and it also helps to nurture the sense of achievement and possibility within our project team as well. Finally, so long as we're discussing quality management, our project management principle of integrating quality into our work is something that simply has to be kept at top of mind throughout the project life cycle. If we are not careful from initiation and planning through the execution of our work through monitoring and controlling our progress and performance and then in how we hand off our project work to whomever the beneficiary of it may be, then we're not going to be able to achieve the quality metrics that we should set and expect of ourselves. Next, we'll discuss in greater detail this sort of quality mindset that allows us to live up to this principle in particular.

## Notes
Key principles that guide the work of project leaders in quality management:

1. **Focus on Value**: Quality and value are closely linked, and achieving high-quality outcomes is essential to delivering value to end-users and stakeholders.

2. **Manage System Interactions**: Project leaders must consider the project's role within the broader organizational ecosystem and the impact of each action on project quality and outcomes.

3. **Address Complexity**: Quality measurement becomes more challenging as project complexity increases, and techniques like root cause analysis are valuable for understanding and resolving quality issues.

4. **Enable Change**: High-quality outcomes facilitate organizational transformation, but it's crucial to ensure that project work is handed over effectively, including documentation, training, and context.

5. **Adaptability and Resiliency**: Quality metrics may need adjustments as project goals shift, but it's important not to compromise on quality standards due to risk tolerance.

6. **Address Opportunities and Threats**: Poor quality management increases the risk of project failure, and risk tolerance should not excuse inadequate quality planning.

7. **Be a Good Steward**: Consider the resources and effort expended in project work, and prioritize quality to create outcomes that serve the organization and end-users.

8. **Tailor the Approach**: Customize quality metrics to meet customer expectations and needs, irrespective of the project's complexity or scope.

9. **Understand Stakeholders**: Quality standards and measurements should align with the perspectives and expectations of stakeholders who are impacted by the project.

10. **Exemplify Commitment**: Project leaders should lead by example in their commitment to quality, fostering a culture of quality within the project team.

11. **Coaching and Development**: Motivate and coach team members to understand the costs of subpar work and the importance of meeting quality criteria.

12. **Foster Accountability and Respect**: Meeting quality criteria builds trust and respect from clients, customers, sponsors, and the project team.

13. **Integrate Quality**: Quality management should be integrated into all phases of the project lifecycle, from initiation and planning to execution, monitoring, and handoff.

These principles guide project leaders in delivering high-quality outcomes and achieving project success.
