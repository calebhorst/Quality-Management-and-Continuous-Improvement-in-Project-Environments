## Module Review
```
Let's take a moment to review. Without quality management, we simply can't be certain that our effort on the project actually will result in us meeting requirements in a satisfactory manner. Solution fitness is something that we have to assess as part of this quality management as well. Ensuring that the work that we've completed actually fulfills stakeholder needs, not just in terms of meeting a set list of requirements, although that's important, but also in the way that the solution will integrate, be used, how resilient it will be, how reliable it is, how well it works free of any defects, what the ongoing costs of operation are, how efficient it is, all of these different facets come into determining how fit a solution is to meeting the needs of our stakeholders. Quality management applies to both the project work itself and to the results that the project creates, and so these are techniques that we should be applying, not only to whatever our end goal might be, but also to the processes we used to create it. Customer‑driven quality may seem tempting at times as being the one that requires the least effort on the front end, but it's also the least effective and often the most expensive because we are simply leaving all of the potential quality issues we face to be discovered by our customers. This will result in warranty work, rework, misunderstandings, and a degraded sense of partnership between us and our customer. Rather, we want to foster a quality‑centric culture and incorporate quality into the core design processes that we use in order to ensure the best outcomes from our project work. Costs related to quality can be broken into one of two categories. Costs of conformance focus on reducing and preventing failure from taking place, while costs of non‑conformance relate to quality failures that have to be addressed, whether we discover them ourselves before handing over the work to the customer or if customer complaints and warranty requests require us to go back and do that work later on. High quality outcomes are always desirable, but high grade outcomes are not always necessary. Oftentimes, creating a solution that is simple, streamlined, and straightforward, and does exactly what we expect it to do is the greatest path to a level of high quality, even though the result is definitionally low grade in nature. This allows us to remain focused on solving essential issues rather than building out something that's much more complex and which might present some challenges in terms of how we even measure whether we've done a good job or not. Precision and accuracy also are not the same thing. Being precise means getting the same results or very close to the same result over and over again, but it doesn't mean that that result is indeed accurate. What we want that result to be is a target. We may have results that are quite accurate, but not precise, always about the same amount of from what our intended target might have been, and we might have those that are very precise, but not remotely accurate. Understanding the relationship between these factors and which is most important to your project's work can help in defining quality criteria. Quality may be managed through a combination of checklists, performance data, and feedback as key components of our quality plan. Changes to quality approaches should be part of a holistic, continuous improvement effort that takes place so we don't simply make arbitrary changes to our quality control, or assurance processes, or to our underlying quality definitions, but rather we understand and are very intentional with the ways that we might modify these plans over time. Weighted ranking systems can help in prioritizing what our quality‑related efforts should look like, as can methods such as pair matching or comparing sets of potential alternatives with one another in order to arrive at the best result. Just as is true with setting our quality criteria itself in advance to ensure that we're objective, we should set our evaluating priorities in advance of any sort of weighted ranking or analysis that we undertake, such that we make sure that we're choosing the solution that actually fits our needs best and serves as the best compromise, not the one with which we might have been most comfortable or predicted as the potential victor going into that analysis effort. In the next module, we'll look at how we can develop a quality management strategy, putting together a plan that can be effective and useful, regardless of the type of project methodology you undertake, from strictly waterfall to strictly agile approaches and everything in between. I'll look forward to seeing you then.

## Notes
In this review, we've covered several key concepts related to quality management in project initiatives. Here's a summary of the main points discussed:

1. **Quality Management's Importance**: Quality management is essential to ensure that project efforts result in meeting requirements and stakeholder needs effectively. Solution fitness, which considers factors like integration, reliability, resilience, efficiency, and more, is a crucial aspect of quality management.

2. **Scope of Quality Management**: Quality management applies to both the project work processes and the outcomes or deliverables of the project. It involves assessing and improving the quality of work methods and the final results.

3. **Customer-Driven Quality**: Relying solely on customer feedback to discover quality issues is not an effective approach. It can lead to increased costs, misunderstandings, and strained customer relationships. A quality-centric culture that integrates quality into the project's core design processes is preferable.

4. **Costs of Quality**: Costs related to quality can be categorized into costs of conformance and costs of non-conformance. Costs of conformance focus on preventing quality issues, while costs of non-conformance relate to addressing quality failures.

5. **Quality vs. Grade**: Quality represents how well a result fulfills its requirements, while grade reflects the sophistication or refinement of the result. High-quality outcomes are always desirable, but high grade is not always necessary.

6. **Precision vs. Accuracy**: Precision is about getting consistent results, while accuracy is about getting results that are close to the intended target. Understanding the relationship between precision and accuracy helps in defining quality criteria.

7. **Quality Metrics**: Quality management involves using metrics to measure performance and outcomes. Metrics can focus on both project attributes (how the team operates) and product attributes (the characteristics of the deliverables).

8. **Continuous Improvement**: Quality management should be part of a continuous improvement effort. Changes to quality approaches should be intentional and based on data and feedback.

9. **Evaluation Methods**: Weighted ranking systems, pair matching, and comparing sets of potential alternatives are methods used to prioritize and select the best quality-related approaches or solutions.

10. **Setting Priorities**: Prioritize criteria and weightings in advance of evaluations to ensure that the chosen solution aligns best with project needs and objectives.

11. **Developing a Quality Management Strategy**: In the next module, you will learn how to develop a quality management strategy that can be applied across various project methodologies, from waterfall to agile.

Understanding and implementing effective quality management practices are essential for delivering successful projects that meet stakeholder expectations and requirements.
