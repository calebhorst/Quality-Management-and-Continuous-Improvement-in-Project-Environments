## Module Review
```
Let's take a moment to review. Dashboards and status reports ensure that project leaders remain aware of performance and quality. These sorts of visualization and high‑level quality management techniques are particularly important in projects that might either be technical or quite complex in nature given that it's difficult for project managers to dive deeply into the raw performance data and gather the sort of information they need to balance the project's constraints. Rather, being able to zoom out and see how these various factors might interlink with one another can give us a better idea as to what sort of interactions might be causing quality issues and where there may be opportunities we can leverage as well. Status meetings can alert leaders to quality issues that are not yet apparent in the data, but it's incumbent on leaders to ensure that those on the project team feel like they can come forward truthfully and transparently in sharing what their concerns regarding quality might be at all times. This, after all, will inevitably save significant consternation down the line. If we learn about problems early on, we can solve them. If we train employees through our actions and behaviors to instead hide problems, hope that they'll go away, hope that they don't need to get addressed, or try to solve them without assistance, then we will inevitably find a nonconforming output that requires much more time and resources in order for us to resolve the problem. Issue logs and well‑defined action items help to ensure that quality matters are addressed once they've been unearthed. It's important for us to maintain this sort of alignment and ownership over issues once they've been identified. After all, it's not enough simply to have found them. We need to be able to do something about them once we know about them as well. Flow charts, fishbone diagrams, and Pareto diagrams help to identify where problems or risks that impair quality may exist within our work and can help us in diving more deeply in understanding how we could resolve those issues as well. Data models, matrix diagrams, and mind maps help to illustrate the relationship between various project components, again, providing us an opportunity to determine where quality can best be measured and to identify areas where quality concerns may exist. Run charts, histograms, and scatter diagrams illustrate our project performance to date and can also indicate if there are any trends that are bringing what was at one point a conforming process into an area of alarm where we would need to identify the problem and seek to resolve it. Quality control involves finding quality issues and validating the deliverables meet underlying requirements. Our control efforts can lead to lessons learned and better processes that we can implement both within our own project, as well as for future initiatives in the organization. Regular reassessment is necessary for this quality control to be effective. In Agile environments, this comes somewhat naturally at the end of each sprint when we can turn back to the work we've completed and consider what we might do differently moving forward. In more prescriptive Waterfall environments, it's all the more important for us to carve out the time on a regular basis to assess our quality measures, as well as our quality performance to ensure that they remain aligned. Customer feedback, team commitment, partner relationships, and various methodologies can help to drive our continuous improvement efforts. Agile teams can verify quality results often through a variety of testing protocols that exist, especially in software development where much of this testing can be automated. In any case, ensuring that we are testing in a manner that helps us to understand the underlying quality of our work and that we are continuing to find new ways to improve our quality and identify any issues where our quality may be lacking really stands at the heart of our work here in managing project quality. And with that, we've come to the end of this course on project quality management. Congratulations! Depending on what brought you to this course in the first place, there's a few other courses I might recommend you take next. If you've been studying to learn more about project management or to prepare to earn your PMP Project+ or CAPM certifications, I recommend you watch Managing Risks in Project Environments next. If you've been following along as part of our Agile Transformation for Leaders path, I'd recommend that you check out Procurement Management in Project Environments next. And for those of you watching as part of our Agile Transformation for Team Members path, I'd recommend you check out Coordinating with Remote Teams next. Here at Pluralsight, we're always introducing new content on subjects like project management and business analysis. To be among the first to know each time in new course in one of these subject areas becomes available, you can go to pluralsight.com/profile/author/casey‑ayers and click the Follow button underneath my profile picture. That way, you'll get an email each time a new course in one of these subject areas is released. I hope to see you in another course soon, but for now, once again, congratulations, and thanks for joining me.

## Notes
**Quality Management Overview:**
- Quality management is crucial in project management to ensure that project goals and customer expectations are met.
- Quality encompasses meeting requirements, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement.

**Understanding Quality:**
- Quality can be defined by meeting project requirements, adhering to standards, and achieving customer satisfaction.
- Internal and external factors influence quality, including project objectives, budget, and stakeholder needs.

**Quality Planning:**
- Quality planning involves defining project objectives, standards, and metrics for quality.
- The Project Quality Management Plan outlines how quality will be managed throughout the project.

**Quality Assurance:**
- Quality assurance focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are followed to maintain quality.
- It includes process audits, training, and process improvement initiatives.

**Quality Control:**
- Quality control aims to identify and address defects in project deliverables.
- Techniques such as inspections, testing, and audits are used to control quality.

**Quality Measurement Tools:**
- Various tools and techniques, including flowcharts, fishbone diagrams, Pareto diagrams, and histograms, help identify and analyze quality issues.
- Run charts and scatter diagrams are used to monitor trends and correlations.

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Continuous improvement involves using customer feedback, team commitment, and methodologies to enhance project quality.
- The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is a framework for continuous improvement.

**Testing and Integration:**
- Agile teams emphasize regular testing and integration of components to ensure quality.
- Test-driven development, spikes, and bake-offs help teams maintain quality standards.

**Key Concepts:**
- Attributes sampling vs. variable sampling: Different approaches for measuring conformance to standards.
- Tolerances vs. control limits: Setting acceptable ranges for project work.
- Partner relationships: Collaborating with long-term partners for quality improvement.
- Improvement methodologies: Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Lean, and others facilitate quality enhancement efforts.

**Course Conclusion:**
- Monitoring project quality through dashboards, status reports, and regular meetings is essential.
- Issue logs, flowcharts, and data models help address quality issues.
- Continuous improvement involves ongoing efforts to enhance project quality.
- Agile teams prioritize testing, integration, and collaboration for quality assurance.
