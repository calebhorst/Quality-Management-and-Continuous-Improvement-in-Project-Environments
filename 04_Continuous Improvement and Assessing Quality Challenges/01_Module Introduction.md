## Module Introduction
```
Welcome back. In this module, we'll wrap things up by looking at how we can continue to improve our quality management efforts and assess the quality challenges that we face by leveraging a variety of tools and techniques. We'll begin by looking at how we can manage project quality more effectively. Then, we'll look at some of the visualization methods that we use in order to understand our quality performance and conduct our management activities. From there, we'll move on to look at quality control in project initiatives and how it differs from our quality planning and quality assurance efforts. Then, we'll wrap up by looking at continuous improvement of our quality management efforts and how we can refine our underlying quality management and our product itself as our work on the project continues. Let's get started.
