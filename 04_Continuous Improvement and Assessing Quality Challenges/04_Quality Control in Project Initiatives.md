## Quality Control in Project Initiatives
```
Much of what we've talked about so far focuses either on effective quality planning, thinking about how we can manage our quality throughout the project life cycle effectively or on quality assurance, which is how we can focus on keeping problems from happening in the first place and infusing a qualit‑focused mindset into our project work. However, the other component here is quality control, where we root out issues with quality that do occur despite our best efforts, and validate the project deliverables meet our quality requirements. There's some additional language related to quality control in particular that we should understand in order to have a better grasp of this domain of quality management. Prevention helps us to keep errors from occurring in the first place, while inspection finds errors that have occurred already. Quality control focuses on inspection, while quality assurance focuses on prevention. Attribute sampling indicates whether a sample does or does not conform to the standards that we have set, while in the case of variable sampling, conformance is rated on a continuous scale. So with attributes sampling, we're looking at something pretty binary. We do or we don't meet the standard. With variable sampling, we're looking at, perhaps on a 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 scale, how well we actually have met that target. Here too, we may have a set threshold of some sort that we consider acceptable, such as having to score at least 70% on a particular metric. But this is why it's important to define such criteria at the beginning of our work in quality management, rather than after we've already began to take samples so that we can ensure that we don't tarnish the validity of our quality control by putting the goalposts at a point that's quite convenient. Tolerances are a range of acceptable results for our work. while control limits are a typical statistical range of variation that's occurred. Our tolerances may be broader than our control limits. In some cases. Our tolerances may be broader than our control limits in some cases. We're turned back to the example of having to be within a plus or minus 5 mm of a target width for a type of manufacturing we undertake. In that case, we may consider those to be our control limits, where we want to make sure we're within plus or minus 5 mm, but our actual tolerance might be actually plus and minus 8 mm. It could be that an output that is outside of the control limits still fits within our tolerances, but means that our process can no longer be defined as within control and must be addressed to ensure that we bring that level of variation down to something more manageable, such that we ensure that we never do surpass what those tolerance levels may be. When it comes to audits and quality control, identifying gaps and nonconforming work is central to audits that take place within equality control context. However, capturing best practices that exist is equally important. We typically think of audit teams is only investigating to try to figure out what's gone wrong, but in reality, especially in larger enterprises where there might be multiple teams that can stand to learn from each other's examples, effective audit teams go further, not only finding what's gone wrong, but also what's gone quite well, such that new best practices might be documented. They also can help to convey any industry standards that exist to provide the team with necessary context for them to complete their work more effectively and they can help in identifying the need for assistance or provide the team, or provide the team with an outreach opportunity where team members could request additional assistance from a quality perspective to ensure that we're able to meet our requirements. Checklists relate to quality control as well. Just as we may use checklist from a quality assurance standpoint to check things as we do them to ensure that they meet standards, checklist can also facilitate confirmation that procedures have been followed, requirements have been met, and so on. In addition to checklists, we find that check sheets are also useful within a quality control environment. Also known as tally sheets, these are used to catalog attribute data during inspections. Frequency and the type of defects or issues that are found are most typically, what we catalog using these check sheets. And we may in fact have certain thresholds that we find acceptable in terms of things like a defect rate within our quality control, passed which we would reassess the production processes that we're using to understand why our defect rate is above our level of comfort. Statistical sampling can also be useful to quality control just as it is in quality assurance. Sampling involves close inspection of a random subset of the population in order to maximize the effectiveness of our quality management, while realizing that there are limits to the amount of resource is that we can apply to quality management, while still moving forward on the project's work itself. For example, we may identify and inspect a random 50 units out of 1000 identical parts in order to see if they indeed meet our criteria. If they do, we can make the assumption based on our predetermined agreements that the other ones must meet these requirements as well, especially if we do a good job of picking a truly random sample size. On the other hand, if we find a wide array of defects within the small sample, it may merit inspecting all of our other items to see if there might be other issues found within them as well. Statistical sampling helps us to balance our time and cost realities with our quality‑related needs, but is another area where we must be careful to ensure that we set our criteria in advance. We need to decide how many items must be inspected and how confident we can be that they are a representative sample of the overall quality of our project's output. These decisions being made in advance helps to ensure that we're objective in our approach and that we have agreement from the customer, sponsor, or other key stakeholders that this method is sufficient for our quality management needs. Questionnaires and surveys can be useful in learning about customer satisfaction after project components are delivered, given that a portion of our quality control effort continues after we've actually handed over that result to our customer or end user. This is where things like support, warranty claims, and ongoing upgrades or revisions will be driven by the feedback we receive from those stakeholders. It can be very valuable in guiding our ongoing development efforts, especially in either multi‑phase projects or in agile environments where we're constantly iterating on our solution to try to maximize stakeholder value. Some of the other techniques that we previously have mentioned with quality assurance may also be useful here as well. Those like fishbone diagrams may help to identify problems and potential solutions. These solutions may be related to project processes or to nonconforming or inadequate results, allowing us to either fix the underlying output of our project or the way we went about creating it wrongly in the first place. Coherent change control processes help to ensure efficiency and quality throughout our work. If we make our changes haphazardly, don't communicate them, don't have a uniform way in which they might be approved or rejected, we may find that we approve certain changes that cause integration issues and other portions of our project work, or we may find that not all stakeholders are aware of the changes that need to be. These sorts of issues can lead to other cascading negative effects in the future, where our repair in one area causes issues to emerge in several others. Another area to consider as part of our quality control efforts is whether or not we've built up a level of technical debt of poor quality work. This may necessitate re‑factoring, more robust testing, and reconsidering our definition of done moving forward, if we find that too many of our tasks simply fall below our quality threshold. Adopting a continuous improvement mindset and a high commitment to quality that's consistent throughout our project work can help to avoid this sort of creeping technical debt of small quality issues continuing to accumulate until we cannot ignore them any longer and must cease forward motion on the project in order to address them. Basically quality control boils down to two possibilities. Either our solution is delivering the targeted value that we had defined, in which case continuous improvement and refinement efforts are where we should place our focus. Even if we're meeting that target, our work's not done. We can still find ways to be better, even if just a bit. On the other hand, our solution may not be delivering sufficient value at all, in which case we have one of a couple different decisions to make. We could choose to make changes to our work, hopefully revising it to better align with what our targets might be. We could choose to simply continue work without making changes. If we feel like the insufficient value is caused by some sort of external one off event that we don't anticipate impacting our project again, moving forward or the problem might be so deep into the projects own planning that we decide that we should cancel the work altogether because we no longer have benefits that exceed costs in order to complete our work. So long as we either choose to continue or to make changes, we should reassess our quality regularly, beginning this cycle again to check our results, to check the processes that lead to those results and see where improvements may be found.

## Notes
1. **Prevention vs. Inspection**: Quality control focuses on inspection, which involves finding errors that have already occurred. This is different from quality assurance, which is all about prevention—keeping errors from happening in the first place.

2. **Attribute vs. Variable Sampling**: Attribute sampling involves determining whether a sample conforms to predefined standards, often with binary outcomes (conforming or non-conforming). Variable sampling assesses conformance on a continuous scale. It's important to define criteria in advance to avoid subjectivity.

3. **Tolerances vs. Control Limits**: Tolerances represent the range of acceptable results for a project, which can be broader than control limits. Control limits are statistical ranges that indicate the typical variation within a process. Tolerances should be set based on project requirements.

4. **Audits and Quality Control**: Audits in a quality control context aim to identify gaps and non-conforming work. However, they should also capture best practices and industry standards to promote continuous improvement.

5. **Checklists and Check Sheets**: Checklists are used to confirm that procedures have been followed and requirements met. Check sheets (tally sheets) are used to catalog attribute data during inspections, helping to track defect frequencies.

6. **Statistical Sampling**: Statistical sampling involves inspecting a random subset of a population to assess quality efficiently. It's essential to determine the sample size and confidence level in advance to maintain objectivity.

7. **Questionnaires and Surveys**: These tools are valuable for gathering customer feedback and assessing satisfaction after project components are delivered. They guide ongoing development efforts, especially in agile projects.

8. **Change Control Processes**: Implementing coherent change control processes ensures efficiency and quality in managing project changes. It helps prevent integration issues and miscommunication.

9. **Managing Technical Debt**: Quality control efforts should address any accumulation of technical debt caused by poor quality work. This may involve refactoring, robust testing, and redefining "done" criteria.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Regardless of whether the solution meets its target value, a commitment to continuous improvement is essential. There's always room for refinement and enhancement.

11. **Reassess Quality**: Regularly reassessing quality is part of the quality control cycle. It involves checking results, evaluating processes, and seeking areas for improvement.

By integrating quality control practices throughout the project lifecycle and maintaining a continuous improvement mindset, project teams can enhance the quality of their deliverables and ensure they align with stakeholder expectations.
