## Managing Project Quality
```
As part of our quality management efforts, it is obviously important for project managers to be able to devise ways to measure performance. After all, if we don't know how well we're doing, how can we know if we're meeting our quality criteria in the first place? Information on project performance often comes from data sources, status reports, status meetings, and from other sorts of sources that can give us an idea as to how we are progressing on the project's work. Performance dashboards are a popular way to deal with some of the data that can often be unwieldy to work with in its raw form. Creating these dashboards can often help in determining where our areas of focused for quality management should be. These are visual in nature, often using colors to categorize performance information based on criteria that we'll have developed in advance in order to better understand what might be performing above expectations, with expectations, and below expectations. A simple example here would be this stoplight style version of looking at our project performance in a variety of different categories. Here we may see that we're doing quite well on cost, both with deliverables A and B, and running right along expectations on deliverable C. For schedule though, we see that we're falling behind on deliverable A, running about where we expected to be on deliverable B, and a bit ahead of schedule on C. As far as fulfilling our requirements, we see that we're doing about as well as expected so far on deliverable A. Whereas we're ahead of schedule or perhaps exceeding the definition of our requirements with our performance in deliverable B. However, deliverable C should give us pause from a quality standpoint in particular as it indicates that we've fallen behind in meeting our requirements. Given the fact that we actually show as ahead of schedule and on par for cost, this may indicate that we've completed the work, but that it has since failed our quality control, which was meant to verify whether or not our work actually meets objectives. This is an area where we may wish to focus some of our quality management efforts moving forward. Status reports share a greater level of detail regarding progress than a dashboard can effectively capture in a purely visual and simplistic format. These may be developed in lieu of or for the purpose of hosting status meetings where we can discuss each of these items in more detail with relevant stakeholders. Status reports typically include the progress since the last report might have been submitted, expected progress by the time the next report rolls around, review of schedules, budgets and risk status, as well as information on implemented and recommended changes and other pertinent information. Of course, the content and the cadence of any used status reports will vary from team to team. As a project leader, it may be partly up to you to determine what type of reports could prove most useful in managing quality and other aspects of your project work. These status reports often do become the subject of status meetings that allow project staff to coordinate and share information with project management. Status meetings that include the project sponsor, customer, and other key stakeholders can also be very helpful. These are particularly valuable in providing insight to issues that may not appear in our data or may not yet appear as it can help us to understand the context of our subject matter experts and what they might perceive as being a problem with our project performance several days or perhaps even weeks before it would show up in our data sources as lagging behind. It gives us a key opportunity to capture any project issues for review and to discuss potential changes and additions. Our ability to conduct quality management by way of these status meetings and performance reviews is subject to whether or not we're able to build a constructive relationship with all of those involved. It's important for us to make sure that such meetings are actually open forums for discussion to take place. If everyone can't feel as if it's a safe space for them to be honest and forthright about any reservations they may have or about any complications and challenges they see, much less any opportunities they might have identified that we may wish to pursue, then we won't be able to get much value out of these meetings. This is important because effective status meetings typically yield important items for follow up. An issues log includes information about potential risks and problems that we may face, as well as any quality‑related matters that need to be addressed. A list of action items indicates what should be followed up on after the meeting and typically will include quality‑related items such as addressing any issues, aberrations, or non‑conformities in the performance of our product as delivered and developed so far. An issues log should include an ID number, important dates, a description of the issue, reporter and owner names for any given problem that we face, a rating of the impact of the issue on the project and its success, as well as our plan for action and the current status of the issue and any actions we may seek to address it. Obviously, items like this issues log, as well as simply having status meetings or being able to review status reports do more than simply allow us to manage quality, although that is an essential component of what they provide., these are tools that project managers may indeed use from a variety of perspectives, including managing costs and schedule, managing stakeholder relationships and the resources that are allocated to different portions of the project. The point being that all of these potentially have an impact on the quality of our processes and the quality of our output. And therefore we should consider from a quality perspective how we can use each of these tools in order to ensure that we're meeting our objectives and that we can continue to do so and to improve moving forward. Key performance indicators are essential to the creation of effective dashboards and metrics and also to our ability to measure and define the quality of our work. We must develop indicators that are measurable and relevant to our project objectives in order to see how well our solution is performing and how fit our solution is for meeting those requirements. Such key performance indicators or KPIs may measure cost or schedule performance for sure, but also our quality performance, our ability to fulfill our requirements to the letter. It may indicate how well project objectives are being met, most specifically through that quality data. Examples of quality‑related KPIs might include deliverables must vary from specifications by no more than +/‑ 5 millimeters. We know exactly how to measure that. We know what we need to do to see if it conforms to our standards. This gets back a little bit to the difference between precise and accurate as well. If we notice that our various results that we capture are well within the +/‑ 5 millimeters area, but they float back and forth, then this might indicate that our process isn't terribly precise, but it is accurate enough for our needs. If on the other hand we see that were consistently off by ‑4 millimeters, then that would indicate that we have a very precise solution indeed, but it's not very accurate. So this is an area where we may wish to address and find ways that we can tune it even closer to our actual target given that we've hit a level of precision and we may be able to adjust it accordingly. Another example of a quality‑related KPI would be making sure that system uptime exceeds 99.9% over a 90‑day test period. This gets back to the heart of fitness of solutions given that resiliency and reliability are central to this particular performance indicator and what it is meant to indicate. Spending time crafting quality performance indicators that align with your underlying project objectives and adequately represent what it is that the client or stakeholders see as the most important objectives or outcomes of our project work is well worth the time. It may be possible by not producing very high‑quality work for us to game other indicators, such as showing ourselves as being ahead of schedule or below budget. But none of that matters at all if we have not created something of maximum usefulness and value, and that's what quality can help us to measure. Next, let's look at some of the visualization methods that can help us to better understand our quality performance as we develop those quality criteria.

## Notes
1. **Performance Dashboards**: Dashboards are visual tools that use color-coded indicators to categorize performance data. They provide a quick and easy way to assess whether performance is above expectations (green), meeting expectations (yellow), or below expectations (red) based on predefined criteria. Dashboards are particularly useful for tracking multiple aspects of a project's performance, such as cost, schedule, and quality, in one concise view.

2. **Status Reports**: While dashboards offer a high-level view, status reports provide a more detailed account of project progress. These reports include information on progress since the last report, expected progress for the next reporting period, schedule updates, budget status, risk assessments, and any changes or recommendations. Status reports serve as valuable tools for discussing project details during status meetings.

3. **Status Meetings**: Regular status meetings involving project stakeholders, sponsors, and team members provide a platform for discussing project issues, progress, and opportunities. These meetings allow for open and constructive discussions and can help identify challenges or quality-related matters that may not be immediately evident in data sources. Building a collaborative and open atmosphere in these meetings is essential for effective quality management.

4. **Issues Log**: An issues log is a structured record of potential risks, problems, and quality-related issues that need to be addressed. It includes details such as issue descriptions, identification numbers, reporting and ownership information, impact ratings, action plans, and current statuses. The issues log helps track and manage problems that may affect project quality.

5. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: KPIs are essential for measuring project performance, including quality. Quality-related KPIs should be measurable and relevant to project objectives. Examples include accuracy and precision metrics, system uptime percentages, and compliance with specific standards or requirements. Developing KPIs that align with project objectives and stakeholder expectations is crucial for effective quality management.
