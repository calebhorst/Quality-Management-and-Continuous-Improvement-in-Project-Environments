## Quality Visualization Methods
```
A moment ago, we mentioned how critical it is to be able to understand our quality data and how understanding the raw data on its own might often be quite complicated, and even if we do understand it, it may cause certain correlations, connections, or root causes to elude us because we get to down into the weeds of that data rather than understanding it at a more conceptual level at which most of us are able to process such information more effectively. Visualization methods can help us to overcome that particular issue. Flowcharts and process maps are a particularly useful way to understand the sequence of steps and possibilities in a process or a group of processes. This may well be our first stop in designing a lot of the work that we'll undertake on the project or how our projects result, the product, the software, the service, what have you that we might be creating, will actually work. Making certain in this conceptual level that we understand how the process will work by looking at the activities, decision points, any branching loops that might exist, as well as parallel paths of action upfront can give us a much better idea as to how resilient and useful this system will be. We can sniff out any issues where there might be an aberrant result based on data being fed into a process that wasn't what we expected, or not having certain information, or making a certain line of decisions resulting in us ending up in a point that we didn't expect. By being able to see all of this at a conceptual level, we can root out these problems, oftentimes before they're developed in the first place, but we can certainly identify where there might be issues after we've begun development more easily using such flowcharts as well. Flowcharts and process maps are useful in understanding how our work unfolds, estimating the cost of quality given where we might seek within a flow to measure our quality performance and how we could go about that, and in determining where and how that quality measurement can indeed take place. Logical data models come next. These are useful for visually representing data and use business language to describe how data is accumulated, transformed, and utilized by whichever process we might build within our product. Consider, for example, a project to create a new software platform for a warehouse that fulfills online orders. In this case, an order may be received by our system and then pass that information along to be transferred into the fulfillment system for picking and packing of those items to be shipped to a customer. At this point, labelling and creating an order confirmation is handled once the pick and pack process has been completed; however, we might be considering a second option where once the order is received, we actually see to both of these items concurrently, labeling a box and printing out an order confirmation before we actually put the items in so that that box is ready for our staff member who goes to retrieve that item. Either of these potential solutions may be valid depending on how we run our warehouse and what we find to be most productive, but you can see how useful it is to be able to immediately compare and contrast what these two might look like using this relatively visual format. Matrix diagrams come next. These express relationships between factors in a visual manner. They may take the standard L shape that we see here where we have labels for rows and for columns, allowing us, as if in a spreadsheet, to understand exactly where a certain piece of information might lie or how it's categorized. Or they may be more complex in nature, utilizing perhaps a T shape where we have potential branches on both sides of a column of descriptors or even multi‑dimensional based on the sort of information we might seek to provide. We can use matrix diagrams for a wide variety of purposes, such as understanding who might be responsible for certain quality aspects of our project, especially in areas where there might be action items in need of being addressed. Matrix diagrams can be very helpful for those. Mind mapping is a visual method for organizing thoughts regarding a central idea, allowing us to expand and see how thoughts branch off into various categories and subcategories based on how concepts might relate with one another. Mind mapping can be helpful in defining quality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships by showing us how various elements and portions of the project connect with one another and interrelate. Fishbone diagrams, also known as cause and effect diagrams or Ishikawa diagrams, trace problems back to their root cause by asking the question why a series of times, allowing us to travel further and further down from our initial symptoms to understanding what the underlying causes of problems and challenges we might encounter may be. Here, we see an example of a fishbone diagram with a problem located on the far right here. There may be a variety of different cause categories that we think might be contributing to the particular problem we're facing. Within those, there may be a variety of primary causes, as well as secondary causes that either cause that primary one in the first place or better explain the myriad of components that may be involved here. Let's look at a specific example. Let's say that our team is running behind schedule. Well, there are a variety of different reasons why this might be the case. It might have to do with our equipment, our processes, the people, our management, the external environment, or maybe our materials. Within here, there are multiple areas again that we can dive into to understand where we might identify some of these problems. Perhaps improper training of our people is to blame, or we have inefficient workflows, and we need to revisit our processes. Perhaps we have inferior equipment or improper materials. Maybe there have been delays from the client, either in providing us with information in the first place or in our ability to get changes or implemented work to be approved. These would certainly hold us up, as would any delayed approvals from our own management. Within these categories, we could dig deeper. For example, in materials, it might be that those materials are improper, either because they're of poor quality or because they are the wrong materials altogether. Whereas with processes, we could see that were simply following an unoptimized set of steps, or it could be that our work is entirely duplicative because we sought to merge multiple processes together and not integrated them in a way that makes sense. Diving further and further into these different areas can help us to scan the overall landscape of our project work and then begin to understand as we dig deeper where the underlying issues might lie that are causing our primary challenge. Pareto diagrams can be very helpful in determining when multiple challenges might be facing a project which ones are causing the most damage. The Pareto rule, which holds that roughly 80% of the problems are probably related to about 20% of the overall causes, helps us to identify which areas should indeed be addressed. Here, for example, we see a graph that shows the causes of our work stoppages. We've combined a hybrid of a bar and line chart in order to gather this information. The bar graph indicates the proportion of individual causes to the problem, for example, roughly 45% of our stoppages being the result of human error, roughly 35% due to mechanical failures, and so on, while the line graph indicates the cumulative proportion of causes to the problem. In other words, we see that human error and mechanical failures are by far the two most important areas for us to address moving forward, while issues related to the external environment or other miscellaneous issues probably aren't worth as much of our time and quality management right now. Run charts come next. These display trends over time and can be useful in judging project performance in a variety of respects. In this case, we see the number of days a project worked and the number of tasks that have been completed over that time. We would probably hope to see a fairly standard linear line from bottom left to top right or perhaps a curve as we continue to perform more highly, learn more, and get more productive as we work together as a team. Here, we see that there's been a plateau lately between day 25 and 30, indicating that we've had more of a struggle finishing these last few tasks on the way to 40 total than we did in some of our earlier phases. It might be worth investigating why this is. Were these tasks that we had sort of shoved off into the future for a while because we lacked the information or knowledge or thought that they might be harder than the other ones to undertake? If so, we probably should have divided those tasks up into more equal segments that better represent what they involve. As it stands, this chart shows that there may be threats to our budget or to our schedule because it's taking us longer than normal to complete those tasks, and so we should probably investigate if there's something we can do to help that. Histograms are a special form of bar chart that represent a statistical distribution. Oftentimes, histograms broadly follow a bell curve in nature, and they're useful in visualizing precision and accuracy in particular. Remember the example from earlier of having to be within plus or minus a few millimeters of a target? Well, we see in a histogram now exactly that sort of data. Perhaps our technical specification in this case is that we have to be within ‑0.42 to +0.4 mm of our target number. We have to be much more precise than we were in the earlier example. In this case, our results are within the requirements, and they're evenly distributed, which means we're being pretty precise and quite accurate with our work. In this case, we see that the results are within requirements, but because of the odd shape here, we see that there's a bias toward being too small rather than being toward too large. In this case, we may wish to address or investigate this issue at minimum to understand why we're deviating from our target mean. In this case, we see that, once again, the results are within our requirements, but we should investigate them because we're above that mean on too regular of a basis. In this case, we see that we have a perfectly formed bell curve, but we have results that are outside of our requirements, meaning that we're not being precise enough with the way that we address this issue. We are also slightly shifted toward too small as a bias as opposed to too large. We should investigate this even though we have a normal looking curve since we're off center and we're outside the range of acceptable results. Finally, scatter diagrams, also known as correlation charts, measure how and to what extent two variables are related to one another. Results may be positive, negative, or there may be no correlation at all. In the case of a positive correlation, we would see a graph that looks something like this. As one value increases, so does the other value. In the case of a negative correlation, as one value increases, the other will decrease. Where there is no correlation, we'd see a graph that looks more like this, kind of a static noise through which we can't really form a line or discern a particular pattern. Use of all of these different techniques and others can be extremely helpful in managing and understanding the quality performance of our project work.
