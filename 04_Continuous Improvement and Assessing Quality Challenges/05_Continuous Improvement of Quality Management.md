## Continuous Improvement of Quality Management
```
In this course, we have consistently mentioned the importance of continuous improvement as part of our quality management efforts, but what exactly does that mean? How can we go about continuous improvement in a way that is somewhat formalized and gives us kind of a road map for how we can actually accomplish this goal? Well, continuous improvement is fed by a few key areas of input. First, the customer feedback that we received as we deliver portions of our projects, work certain components, previews, beta versions, and etc., that we can provide our customers with in order to gain their perspective, give us our definitive measure of success. After all, if the customer's happy and we've met our requirements, then we've done a good job. Customer feedback can also be useful in gauging the usefulness of the quality metrics that we actually select. We may find that we're meeting our quality criteria, but our customers aren't actually happy. If that's the case, we're not measuring the right things, or the targets that we set for ourselves are simply too easy, and we need to come up with more strenuous ways of challenging the work that we've undertaken to ensure that we'll actually meet that level of customer satisfaction we're looking for. Having a culture of commitment within the team is essential to continuous improvement. This means being obsessed with creating that value for customers for sure, but also being committed to not letting down our colleagues on the project team, ensuring that everyone is committed to doing the highest quality level of work, and ensuring that everyone is willing to reach out and alert others if they need help in reaching those goals. In Toyota's assembly plants, for example, as is true in many other auto manufacturers now, every single employee is empowered to pull a cord at their station that brings the entire production line to a halt immediately if they spot anything wrong with quality that requires additional assistance. This sort of empowerment to bring literally an entire factory to a screeching halt if a quality issue is found is something that we hope we won't have to do often, and if we are good about refining our processes over time, can hopefully help to minimize, but it's an important and powerful tool nonetheless because it speaks to the organization's overall commitment to reaching a high level of quality. Our partner relationships are also an area where continuous improvement efforts should be focused. Having long term, mutually beneficial partnerships helps to nurture a quality relationship because these procurement sources can begin to become familiar with what our standards for quality as an organization might be, and how we can work together to achieve those goals. If instead, we simply turn to the lowest common denominator, the lowest bidder in any particular scenario, regardless of our past, relationship or context with them, we may find that we get those parts of it more cheaply or affordably than we could have before, but at what cost? Will we have a lesser level of integration with our overall product? It's entirely possible, especially if we don't provide exacting in very specific directions to that procurement partner regarding what our demands and needs might actually be. Working with partners over the long haul can build the report necessary for higher level, higher‑quality collaboration to take place. Fourth, there are also a variety of improvement frameworks and methodologies that we may turn to as part of this continuous improvement effort. While these are beyond the scope of this course, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Lean, and other methodologies can facilitate improvement efforts taking place not only within our project team, but also for the organization at large. For our project team, however, one of the most important methodologies that we can follow is actually quite simple and consists of just four steps, plan do, check, and act. During the planning phase of this PDCA format, we, well plan our project work. We determine our project objectives and processes, and we set expectations for what our quality metrics and output should be. During the do phase, we actually execute on our plans, completing project objectives and collecting data along the way. This leads into our third phase, where we check the work that we've just completed. We compare our actual results to what our expectations were, and we determine if our plan was effective in helping us to actually achieve these objectives. This leads into our fourth phase of act. We can act on these findings. If we find that the latest cycle is indeed an improvement, then it should become our new baseline moving forward. However, if the latest cycle results in no change or a negative result, we should revert, and we should correct this baseline. We continue this cycle over and over, experimenting with new hypotheses for how we can improve upon our approach, then seeing if they were actually helpful in allowing us to do so. If not, we can trace our steps back and try a new path forward until we arrive at the set of processes and policies that allow us to do our best work. Finally, from an agile point of view, we should seek to integrate our work. Often progress must be tested as part of the whole, not only on its own. And so, while we may be developing one small component of project work at a time, it's important for us to integrate these on a regular basis to ensure that all of our puzzle pieces indeed do match up with one another. Our testing should take place at multiple levels as well. Analyzing performance in a vacuum of a certain component can be useful in determining if that component is functioning as we'd like it to. However, we should also conduct tests within the solution, integrating that component to make sure that it continues to work in a very compatible and effective manner. We also need to consider more broadly how this component and our solution might impact other portions of the organization or other portions of our client's organization. Test‑driven development allows us to focus on this testing approach, while also automating testing so that pre‑defined criteria can facilitate our ongoing quality assessment efforts. Finally, spikes and bakeoffs allow teams to intentionally pause to determine the best path forward. This is the equivalent of being able to pull that cord at the automotive assembly plant, where we're not exactly sure what step would allow us to create the most value next or achieve the sort of quality goals we've set out for ourselves. Spikes allow us to bring the team together to meet and discuss this, to figure out what the next path forward should look like. While bakeoffs allow us to explore several solutions concurrently, choose one after a set period of time, and move forward with our work accordingly. This is in its way similar to the plan, do, check, act cycle of having a theory of what we could do better, trying to execute on it, ensuring that it did indeed improve our approach, and then continuing to implement and integrate these new ideas and processes into our overall workflow over time.

## Notes
Continuous improvement is a fundamental aspect of effective quality management. Here's a summary of the key points related to continuous improvement from your discussion:

1. **Customer Feedback**: Continuous improvement starts with listening to customer feedback. This feedback helps gauge whether project deliverables meet customer expectations and if the right quality metrics are being measured.

2. **Culture of Commitment**: Building a culture of commitment within the team is crucial. Team members should be dedicated to delivering high-quality work and should feel empowered to speak up when they identify quality issues.

3. **Partner Relationships**: Long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships with suppliers and collaborators can contribute to higher quality. These relationships allow partners to understand and align with an organization's quality standards.

4. **Improvement Frameworks and Methodologies**: Various improvement frameworks and methodologies, such as Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), and Lean, can facilitate continuous improvement efforts. These methodologies provide structured approaches to enhancing quality.

5. **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle**: The PDCA cycle is a simple yet effective methodology for continuous improvement. It involves four phases:
   - **Plan**: Define project objectives, processes, and quality metrics.
   - **Do**: Execute the plans, collect data, and implement.
   - **Check**: Compare actual results to expectations and assess the effectiveness of the plan.
   - **Act**: If improvements are identified, make them the new baseline; if not, adjust and iterate.

6. **Integration**: In an agile context, integration of project components is crucial. Regularly test and integrate work to ensure all pieces fit together and perform as expected.

7. **Testing at Multiple Levels**: Testing should occur not only at the component level but also within the solution and within the broader context of the organization. Test-driven development and automated testing can facilitate ongoing quality assessment.

8. **Spikes and Bakeoffs**: Spikes and bakeoffs are mechanisms for pausing and evaluating the best path forward. Spikes allow for exploration and discussion of potential improvements, while bakeoffs involve testing and selecting the best solution after a defined period.

Continuous improvement involves a commitment to refining processes, optimizing quality metrics, and consistently seeking ways to enhance value and meet customer satisfaction. It's a cycle of learning, implementing, assessing, and adjusting that should be an integral part of every project and organization's culture.
